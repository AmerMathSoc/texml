%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  The following function embodies a \LaTeX3 design pattern
%  for representing non-null pointers. This allows data to
%  be 'protected' behind a macro redirection. Any number of
%  expandable operations can be applied to the pointer
%  indiscriminately without altering the data, even when
%  using |:x|, |:o| or |:f| expansion. Expansion using |:v|
%  dereferences the pointer and returns the data exactly
%  as it was passed through |#2|. Expansion using |:c|
%  returns a control sequence through which the data can
%  be modified.
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_protected:Nn \__graph_ptr_new:Nn {
  \withargs [\uniquecsname] {
    \tl_set:Nn #1 {##1}

%  We define some additional

\cs_new_protected:Nn \graph_display_table:N {
  \graph_display_table:Nn #1 {} }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%  The full version has a second argument accepting options
%  that determine table formatting. We first define those options.
%  Please note that with the standard options, the |xcolor| package
%  is required with the |table| option, because of our use of the
%  |\cellcolor| command.
%
%    \begin{macrocode}

  edge_none_format     .value_required:
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%  Now we define the function itself.
%  It displays a table showing the structure and content
%  of graph |#1|. If argument |#2| is passed, its options
%  are applied to format the output.
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_new_protected:Nn \graph_display_table:Nn {

%    \end{macrocode}

%  We process those options passed with |#2|:
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
  \keys_set:nn {lt3graph-display} {#2}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%  We populate the top row of the table:
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
  \tl_put_right:Nn \l__graph_table_content_tl {\hline}
  \seq_clear:N \l__graph_row_seq
  \bool_if:NT \l__graph_display_row_keys_bool

  \bool_if:NT \l__graph_display_vertex_vals_bool

  \tl_put_right:Nn \l__graph_table_content_tl
      { \\\hline\hline }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%  We populate the remaining rows:
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
  \graph_map_vertices_inline:Nn #1 {
    \seq_clear:N \l__graph_row_seq
    \bool_if:NT \l__graph_display_row_keys_bool {

    \graph_map_vertices_inline:Nn #1 {
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%  We start building the vertex cell value. First we distinguish
%  between a direct connection, a transitive connection,
%  and no connection, and format accordingly:
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
      \graph_get_edge:NnnNTF #1 {##1} {####1} \l_tmpa_tl {
        \quark_if_no_value:VF \l_tmpa_tl {
          \tl_set_eq:NN \l__graph_cell_content_tl \l_tmpa_tl
          \tl_set:Nf \l__graph_cell_content_tl
              { \exp_args:NV \l__graph_format_edge_direct_tl
                             \l__graph_cell_content_tl } }
      }{\graph_acyclic_if_path_exist:NnnTF #1 {##1} {####1} {
        \tl_set_eq:NN \l__graph_cell_content_tl
            \l__graph_format_edge_transitive_tl
      }{
        \tl_set_eq:NN \l__graph_cell_content_tl
            \l__graph_format_edge_none_tl
      }}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%  Secondary formatting comes from cells on the diagonal,
%  i.e., a key compared to itself:
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
      \str_if_eq:nnT {##1} {####1} {
        \tl_set:Nf \l__graph_cell_content_tl
            { \exp_args:NV \l__graph_format_edge_diagonal_tl
                           \l__graph_cell_content_tl } }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%  Tertiary formatting is applied to all vertex value cells:
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
      \tl_set:Nf \l__graph_cell_content_tl
          { \exp_args:NV \l__graph_format_edge_vals_tl
                         \l__graph_cell_content_tl }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%  We can now add the cell to the row sequence:
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
      \seq_put_right:NV \l__graph_row_seq \l__graph_cell_content_tl
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \uninteresting\begin{macrocode}
    }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%  We are finished with this row; go on to the next iteration:
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \tl_put_right:Nx \l__graph_table_content_tl
        { \seq_use:Nn \l__graph_row_seq {&} }
    \tl_put_right:Nn \l__graph_table_content_tl {\\\hline}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \uninteresting\begin{macrocode}
  }
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%  Finally, we print the table itself:
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
  \withargs:VVn \l__graph_table_colspec_tl \l__graph_table_content_tl
    { \begin{tabular}{##1}##2\end{tabular} }
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \uninteresting\begin{macrocode}
  \group_end:
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%  Now follow the local variants and variables
%  used in the function:
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\cs_generate_variant:Nn \quark_if_no_value:nF {VF}
\cs_generate_variant:Nn \withargs:nnn         {VVn}
