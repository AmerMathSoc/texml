%    \begin{abstract}
%      Setting alignments of nucleotides and peptides for publication 
%      or presentation purposes is usually a time consuming two-step process. 
%      First, a scientific software is used for the calculation of the
%      alignment. This
%      is done in a few minutes. Then, in order to highlight special sequence
%      relationships and to label positions and regions of interest a 
%      second software with high quality output capability is needed.
%      Manipulating sequence alignments with standard word processing
%      or graphics programs takes its time---often several hours---and 
%      simple layout changes such as
%      re-breaking lines, say from 50 to 40 residues per line, 
%      elongate the working time considerably.
%      
%      \TeXshade{} is an alignment shading software  
%      written in \TeX/\LaTeX{} which can process
%      multiple sequence alignments in the MSF, ALN 
%      and FASTA file format.
%      It provides in addition to common shading algorithms special
%      shading modes featuring functional aspects, e.\,g.\ charge or
%      hydropathy, and a plenitude of commands for handling
%      shading colors, text styles, labels, legends and even allows 
%      the user to define completely new shading modes. \TeXshade{} 
%      combines highest flexibility and the habitual \TeX{} output 
%      quality---with reasonable time expenditure.

%    The alignment file examples as well as the topology data file are 
%    needed for \TeX{}ing this documentation
%    and can serve as illustrations for the MSF and ALN 
%    file format.
%    
%    The following subsections give an overview on the capabilities of
%    the \TeXshade{} package. All commands are described in detail 
%    later on.

%    \subsection{Version History}
%
%    \textbf{v1.24  2011/12/01}
%    \medskip
%
%    \emph{Introductions:} 
%    The space between the ruler and the top or bottom sequence row
%    can now be adjusted using |\rulerspace| and the textsize of the 
%    ruler numbering can be set with |\setsize| or |\rulerLarge| etc. 
%    Postscript color samples are shown in the manual next to the 
%    color names list.
%    \medskip
%
%    \textbf{v1.23  2011/05/13}
%    \medskip
%
%    \emph{Introductions:} 
%    In diverse mode sequence positions where all residues match do not
%    contain much information. A new command, 
%    |\hideallmatchpositions|, \footnote{Requested by Matt Russell.}
%    will remove all such positions from the alignment and hence condense
%    the output considerably.
%    \medskip
%
%    \textbf{v1.22  2010/10/11}
%    \medskip
%
%    \emph{Introductions:} 
%    Sets of shading colors can be defined and named using
%    |\defshadingcolors| (p.\ \pageref{Ldefshadingcolors}) and different
%    sets of colors can be selected for different sequence blocks by 
%    |\changeshadingcolors| (\ref{Lchangeshadingcolors}).
%    \medskip
%
%
%    \textbf{v1.21 2010/03/01}
%    \medskip
%
%    \emph{Corrections:} |\setdomain| now recognizes a changed |\startnumber|. 
%
%    \emph{Introductions:} 
%    (a) Sequence motifs (\ref{Lshaderegion}) can be given as a selection pattern
%    in sequence stretch labeling commands, such as |\shaderegion|,
%    |\emphregion| or |\frameblock|, instead of numeral stretch definitions.
%    
%    (b) A new type of sequence emphasis by lowercase letters was implemented: 
%    |\lowerregion| and |\lowerblock| (\ref{Llowerregion}).
%    \medskip
%
%    \textbf{v1.20a 2009/11/30}
%    \medskip
%
%    \emph{Corrections:}  Identity/similarity tables
%    work now without having to set a conservation plot in the feature
%    line. 
%    \medskip
%
%
%    \textbf{v1.20 2009/10/05}
%    \medskip
%
%    \emph{Corrections:}  Landscape mode works now correctly.
%    Annoying |Overfull \hbox ...| signals appearing after
%    |\residuesperline*| commands are ignored;
%    domains work now with frequency corrected sequence logos.
%
%    \emph{Introductions:} 
%    (a) New commands for setting residue weight tables were introduced 
%    |\weighttable| (with parameters: |identity|, |structural|,
%    |PAM250|, |PAM100|, and |BLOSUM62|),
%    |\gappenalty|, and |\setweight|.
%    (b) Similarity/identity percentage tables can be printed with
%    |\similaritytable|\footnote{Asked for by Giovanni M.\ Lesa.} and  
%    values for specific sequence pairs can be utilized with 
%    |\percentsimilarity{|\meta{seqref1}|}{|\meta{seqref2}|}| and 
%    |\percentidentity{|\meta{seqref1}|}{|\meta{seqref2}|}|.
%    \medskip  
%
%    \textbf{v1.19a 2009/06/11}
%    \medskip
%
%    \emph{Correction:} Gaps are now treated correctly when setting 
%    domains.
%    
%    \emph{Introduction:}
%    Stop-positions in protein sequences (|*| in the input file) can be
%    indicated by a special character (|\stopchar|) in the alignment 
%    output.\footnote{Suggestion by Yun He.}
%    \medskip  
%
%    \newpage
%
%    \textbf{v1.19 2009/03/09}
%    \medskip
%
%    \emph{Correction:} Logo characters are now horizontally 
%    scalable using |\charstretch|. Minor bugs were fixed.
%    
%    \emph{Introduction:}
%    (a) Selection of residue positions was enhanced (\ref{Lshaderegion}) 
%    \TeXshade{} can
%    now select residues based on their 3D coordinates provided in a 
%    PDB structure file. 3D selection can be due to a certain distance 
%    around a point, along a line, or above and below a plane. It
%    works with |\feature|, |\shaderegion|, |\shadeblock|, |\tintregion|,
%    |\tintblock|, |\emphregion|, |\emphblock|, |\frameblock|.
%    (b) The list of selected residues is printable with |\printPDBlist| or 
%    viewable during the \TeX{} run with |\messagePDBlist|.
%    (c) |\hideblock| and related commands were replaced by |\setdomain|
%    (\ref{Lsetdomain}). 
%    This command will display only selected residues in the alignment.
%    Thickness and colors of a domain separator rule can be set using
%    |\domaingaprule| and |\domaingapcolors|.
%    \bigskip
%
%    \textbf{v1.18 2008/04/15}
%    \medskip
%
%    \emph{Correction:} several bug fixed concerning featurename
%    display, sequence ordering and numbering.
%    
%    \emph{Introduction:}
%    (a) T-Coffee shading information can be loaded and put on the
%    alignment.\footnote{Suggestion by Florian Mertes.} 
%    The conservation data can also be displayed in the 
%    consensus as well as feature color scales and bar plots.
%    (b) Two more feature lines were added on the top and at the
%    bottom (|ttttop|, |tttop|, |bbbottom|, |bbbbottom|).
%    (c) The |startnumber| and |setends| commands have been fused;
%    either command can set both, a new start number as well as
%    end definitions of the sequence section to be displayed.
%    \bigskip
%
%    \textbf{v1.17 2007/06/19}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \emph{Introduction:}\footnote{Asked for by Marat Kazanov.}
%    (a) A second threshold percentage was introduced in order to label
%    two levels of conservation in `identical' and `similar' mode. This is 
%    achieved by setting an optional parameter in |\threshold| or in 
%    |\allmatchspecial|, or by using a number as an optional parameter in 
%    |\shadingmode|. (b) The feature lines can be additionally labeled with
%    a name left or right of the feature. This is handled using
%    |\showfeaturename|, |\showfeaturestylename|,
%    |\hidefeaturename|, |\hidefeaturestylename|,
%    |\hidefeaturenames|, |\hidefeaturestylenames|.
%    The color of such names can be changed with
%    |\featurenamecolor|, |\featurestylenamecolor|,
%    |\featurenamescolor|, |\featurestylenamescolor|,
%    Font styles in feature names can be set as usual, e.g.
%    |\setsize{featurenames}{large}| or
%    |\featurestylenamesrm|.
%    \bigskip
%
%
%    \textbf{v1.16 2007/02/18}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \emph{Correction:} \TeXshade{} crashed when calculating conservation
%    using sequences with untypical residue characters, such as "X".
%    Fixed. The reference sequence in diverse mode can now be shaded with
%    |\conservedresidues| and, if active, |\allmatchresidues|.\footnote{For this
%    and suggesting |namerulerpos| credit to Marco Pasi.}
%
%    \emph{Introduction:}\footnote{Both extensions were suggested by Phillip Hahn.}
%    (a) A command was introduced, i.e. |\exportconsensus| 
%    which produces a pymol script file for coloring a 3D model according to 
%    \TeXshade's conservation calculation. (b) With |namerulerpos| labels of the
%    ruler can be exchanged by a string. (c) Various parts of the alignment 
%    can now be hidden by |\hideblock|. 
%
%    \emph{New home:} \TeXshade, \TeXtopo, and \BioTeX{} have a new home:
%    |www.pharmazie.uni-kiel.de/chem/Prof_Beitz/biotex.html|.
%    \bigskip
%
%
%    \textbf{v1.15 2006/06/27}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \emph{Correction:} Sequence and subfamily logos can now be plotted
%    with pdflatex; pstricks is not needed anymore.
%    \bigskip
%
%
%    \textbf{v1.14 2006/05/11}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \emph{Introduction:} In order to better recognize relevant positions
%    in a subfamily logo [14], a bit-value can now be set by |\relevance|
%    above which a deviation is considered relevant. Such positions
%    can be labeled with a symbol by |\showrelevance| and hidden
%    by |\hiderelevance|.
%    \bigskip
%
%
%    \textbf{v1.13 2006/02/23}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \emph{Corrections:} Helix symbols in feature lines were not drawn
%    correctly if the standard Computer Modern Font was changed to 
%    another one, e.g. Palatino.\footnote{Thanks to Markus Heller} 
%    Fixed. Unintended gaps occurred due to numbers at the
%    end of lines in Clustal W alignment files. Fixed. The limitations
%    in the number of sequences per alignment have finally been overcome
%    by a more restrictive use of counter variables.
%
%    \emph{Introductions:} (a) The numbering can now be displayed---in 
%    addition to left or right---on both sides of the alignment with 
%    the optional parameter |{leftright}| in the |\shownumbering| 
%    command (p.\pageref{Lshownumbering}). (b) TeXshade tries to guess 
%    the sequence type, i.\,e.\ protein or nucleotide, if not defined 
%    by the user. (c) Plotting of sequence logos has been implemented
%    (p.\pageref{Lshowsequencelogo}).
%    Logos can be shown in addition to or together with the consensus,
%    or alone without any alignment sequences. (d) The ruler numbering
%    can be rotated in order to make labeling of every position possible.
%    (e) A new way to visualize subfamily characteristics has been
%    implemented, i.e. subfamily logos (p.\pageref{Lshowsubfamilylogo}) [14].

%    \textbf{v1.12 2005/09/20}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \emph{Corrections:} When regional labeling with |\shaderegion|,
%    |\emphregion|, |\tintregion|, or |\frameblock| was combined with
%    |\setends| incorrect output was produced lacking the
%    labeling.\footnote{Discovered by Chris Page.} Other minor fixes.
%
%    \emph{Introductions:} An additional optional parameter for setting 
%    consensus colors was implemented in the |\showconsensus| command
%    (p.\pageref{Lshowconsensus}). This even allows one to use color 
%    scales illustrating sequence conservation in the consensus line.

%    \textbf{v1.11 2005/04/13}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \emph{Corrections:} Bounding boxes with |\frameblock| had a wrong
%    height when |\separationline|s were used. Other minor fixes.
%
%    \emph{Introductions:} (a) An additional parameter for setting 
%    individual bar and arrow thicknesses in feature lines has been 
%    introduced. (b) Additional parameters for setting the frame color
%    and thickness of boxes in feature lines have been implemented. (c)
%    Three more color scales have been defined: |RedBlue|, |RedGreen|,
%    and |HotCold|. (d) Plotting of amino acid features (|hydrophobicity|,
%    |molweight|, |charge|) as bar graphs or color scales. (e) Plotting
%    of protein sequence |conservation| as bar graph or color
%    scale\footnote{Ahmad Mirza asked for (e) and (f), great suggestion!}.
%    (f) Color scales can be used for shading the consensus sequence
%    according to protein sequence conservation.
%    (g) Separate command for stretching color scales |\colorscalestretch|.

%    
%    \textbf{v1.10 2005/03/29}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \emph{Corrections:} Plotting of color scales and bar graphs has
%    been sped up by more than a factor of 10.\footnote{This and (d)
%    I owe again to Christoph Gille.}
%
%    \emph{Introductions:} (a) More colors have been introduced, i.e. 
%    even lighter versions of the existing PostScript colors 
%    `LightLight' plus color name and `LightLightLight' plus color 
%    name. (b) Sequence stretches and blocks can be tinted for
%    labeling purposes |\tintreqion|, |\tintblock| and |\tintdefault|. 
%    (c) A new feature label style |{restriction}| has been introduced. 
%    (d) Java-typical `NaN' values are now allowed in data files for
%    bar graphs and color scales.

%    \textbf{v1.9 2005/02/08}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \emph{Corrections:} \TeXshade{} version 1.8 introduced an
%    incompatibility with \TeXtopo{}. This problem was identified
%    by Meike Schmedt and has been fixed.
%
%    \emph{Introductions:} (a) A short version of the figure caption
%    can now be defined for display in the list of figures\footnote{%
%    Meike, here you go \dots} |\shortcaption{|\meta{text}|}|. (b) A
%    colored frame can be drawn around a sequence block for labeling
%    purposes with the command |\frameblock|.\footnote{Alan Robinson, 
%    this is for you.} (c) A new look for feature arrows has been 
%    implemented with scalable line thickness and a new end style
%    `ball'. (d) HMMTOP topology predictions can
%    now be included for plotting feature lines with information on
%    the location of the transmembrane domains.\footnote{Implemented

%    
%    \emph{Corrections:} Only minor bugs were fixed.
%
%    \emph{Introductions:} (a) More colors have been designed, i.e. 
%    `light' versions of the existing PostScript colors. (b) 
%    Three color ramps in 5\% steps have been introduced: 
%    i) Blue-Red, ii) Green-Red and iii) Cold-Hot.
%    (c) Two new feature label styles |bar| and |color| have been 
%    introduced which allow one to display number
%    values as bar graphs or color scales along the
%    alignment\footnote{Inspired by Christoph Gille's {\tt STRAP}}. 
%    \bigskip
%
%
%    \textbf{v1.7 2004/01/05}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \emph{Corrections:} Several bugs were fixed.
%    In gaps the wrong character was plotted in `donotshade'
%    mode. Gaps were colored incorrectly when a single 
%    sequence was set as consensus. Another `donotshade' problem was 
%    solved which led to a halt of the LaTeX 
%    run\footnote{Thanks to Jeferson J.\ Arenzon and Naomi Siew}. 
%    Due to several requests, the gap and match labels in |diverse|
%    mode were switched (`|-|' in gaps; `|.|' at matching
%    positions) in order to follow convention.
%
%    \emph{Introduction:} \TeXshade{} speaks spanish (|\spanishlanguage|).
%    Necessary translations were contributed by Mikel Ega\~na Aranguren.
%    A new feature label style |helix| has been introduced.
%    \bigskip
%
%
%    \textbf{v1.6 2002/03/26}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \emph{Corrections:} The unnecessary restriction to the DVIPS
%    driver for |color.sty| has been removed\footnote{As suggested by
%    Eckhart Guth\"ohrlein.}. Any color.sty compatible
%    driver option can be given with the |\usepackage{texshade}| call
%    and is then passed to the |color| package. The `|\namecolor|' and 
%    `|\numbercolor|' commands do now support sequence 
%    lists.\footnote{Thanks to Denys Bashtovyy.}
%        
%    \emph{Introductions:} (a) The FASTA file format is supported by
%    \TeXshade{} as alignment inputs. (b) Two commands set the space
%    between sequence blocks either to be flexible (as so far) 
%    `|\flexblockspace|' or the be fixed `|\fixblockspace|'. (c) One 
%    can now refer to sequences by their name in addition to the number
%    in the input file. (d) Using
%    `|\firstcolumnDSSP|' and `|\secondcolumnDSSP|' one can choose 
%    which of the first to columns should refer to the sequence numbering 
%    (the second column remains default setting)\footnote{c and d were
%    suggested by Christoph Gille.}.

%    
%    \emph{Corrections:} `X's in the alignment file caused a run-time
%    error. Fixed.
%        
%    \emph{Introductions:} (a) The vertical space between feature
%    lines can be controlled by four new commands: |\ttopspace|,
%    |\topspace|, |\bottomspace| and 
%    |\bbottomspace|\footnote{Suggested by Ulrike Folkers.}. (b) It is 
%    now easily possible to add a caption to the alignment with 
%    the |\showcaption| command. (c) \TeXshade{} stores the 
%    sequence lengths in the |.aux| file in order to have correct
%    breaks of the gaps after the sequences.

%    \textbf{v1.4\&4a 2000/9/12 \& 2000/10/3}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \emph{Introductions:} (a) The alignment legend can now be moved 
%    by the command `|\movelegend|'. (b) In commands with parameters 
%    that contain series of sequence numbers, e.\,g. |\orderseqs|, a
%    dash can be used, e.\,g. |{1-3,6-4,7}| instead of 
%    |{1,2,3,6,5,4,7}|.

%    \medskip
%    
%    \emph{Introductions:} (a) It is now possible to force \TeXshade{} to 
%    display gap symbols before and after the actual sequence 
%    by the commands `|\showleadinggaps|' and `|\hideleadinggaps|'
%    (\ref{Lshowleadinggaps}).
%    (b) The sequence names input routine is now more tolerant concerning
%    special characters.

%    
%    \textbf{v1.3 2000/3/3}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \emph{Corrections:} Line scrambling occured when features where
%    set in the |ttop| row without a feature in the |top| row. Fixed.
%    The incompatible command `|\language|' with the |babel| package has been
%    replaced by `|\germanlanguage|' and `|\englishlanguage|'\footnote%
%    {Thanks to Eckhart Guth\"ohrlein.}.
%    
%    \emph{Introductions:} (a) Now, translations of sequence stretches
%    are possible. Either nucleotide or amino acid sources can be 
%    translated. This is done by the new |{translate}| option for the 
%    feature command. (b) The codons are defined by the new command
%    `|\codon|'. Complete codon sets can be loaded by `|\geneticcode|'.
%    (c) Further, the size and style of the nucleotide triplets of
%    backtranslations can be set by `|\backtranslabel|' and 
%    `|\backtranstext|'. (d) Two more feature counter styles were introduced:
%    `|\Romancount|' and `|\romancount|'. (e) \TeXshade{} is now 
%    compatible with \TeXtopo, a new \TeX{} software
%    for drawing and shading topology plots of membrane proteins.

%    
%    \textbf{v1.2a 1999/6/24 (not released)}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \emph{Minor corrections:} `|\namecolor|' and `|\numbercolor|' are 
%    now really correctly reordered. Brackets ( and ) are now allowed
%    in sequence names. The option |{case}| in `|\funcshadingstyle|' 
%    works now.

%    \textbf{v1.2 1999/6/12}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \emph{Corrections:} (a) Functional group definitions of more than
%    seven groups produced an error when displaying group number
%    eight. These residues where skipped in the alignment. Fixed.
%    
%    \emph{Introductions:} (a) Protein secondary structure files in the DSSP,
%    STRIDE and PHD format can be included and displayed auto\-matically
%    within the alignment by `|\includeDSSP|' (and similar commands for 
%    STRIDE, PHDsec and PHDtopo, \ref{structure}).
%    (b) Which types of secondary structures are to be included or
%    skipped in the alignment is chosen by `|\showonDSSP|' and 
%    `|\hideonDSSP|' (and respective commands for STRIDE, PHDsec and PHDtopo).
%    (c) The appearance of the labels is defined by `|\appearance|'.
%    (d) Internal counters for repeatedly occuring structure types
%    can be activated by `|\numcount|', `|\alphacount|' and
%    `|\Alphacount|'. All commands are described in \ref{structure}.

%        
%
%    \textbf{v1.1 1999/5/26}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \emph{Corrections:} (a) The activation of `|emphregion|' lead to 
%    an em\-pha\-sized following alignment. This has been 
%    corrected. (b) `|\namecolor|' and `|\numbercolor|' were not 
%    reordered with the command `|orderseqs|'. Fixed. (c) Sequence 
%    gaps at the beginning or the end of a sequence, i.\,e. before
%    the first and after the last residue where labeled with the
%    gap symbol. Now these positions are left blank.
%    
%    \emph{Introductions:} (a) In order to treat the preceeding and 
%    sequence following gaps correctly, \TeXshade{} needs to know the
%    length of the sequences. Therefore, the command `|\seqlength|' was
%    introduced (\ref{seqlines}). (b) With `|\gapcolors|' (also 
%    \ref{seqlines}) the
%    color selection for gap symbols is independent from non conserved
%    residues. (c) The divisions of the ruler where so far fixed to
%    10. Now, this value is changeable by `|\rulersteps|' (again 
%    \ref{seqlines}). (d) `|\hideresidues|' and `|\showresidues|' turn
%    off or on the residue names, i.\,e. one can choose between a
%    display of shaded boxes only or with letters in the boxes 
%    (\ref{kill}). (e) The changes (c) through (d) were necessary 
%    for the introduction of `|\fingerprint|'. This command allows one to
%    display the complete sequence in one line for an easy survey of
%    the alignment (\ref{fingerprint}).

%    \subsection{\LaTeX{} basics}
%    
%    \subsubsection{Typesetting documents using \LaTeX}
%    
%    In order to use any of the macros provided by the 
%    \BioTeX-project 
%    (\TeXshade/\TeXtopo) efficiently a basic understanding of the \TeX{} 
%    typesetting system and its usage is required. Several books are
%    available on this topic, but a rather quick and easy introduction
%    is the \emph{Not so short introduction to \LaTeX}. This document
%    is available from all Comprehensive \TeX{} Archive Network 
%    (CTAN) servers,
%    e.\,g. from |ftp://ftp.dante.de/pub/tex/documentation/lshort/|,
%    in many different languages and formats besides \LaTeX{}, such 
%    as \textsc{PostScript} and on-line viewable PDF.
%    I also put a link from the \BioTeX{} (\TeXshade/\TeXtopo) homepage 
%    to the document collection
%    (|http://pharmazie.uni-kiel.de/chem/Prof_Beitz/BioTeX|).
%    
%    
%    \subsubsection{Memory shortness when using \TeX{}shade}
%    
%    If you are using \TeXshade{} to align several large sequences (about 1000
%    residues/sequence), LaTeX will probably stop compiling and quit with one
%    of the following messages: 
%    
%    |!\ TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [main memory size=384000]| 
%    
%    or 
%    
%    |!\ TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [stack size=300]|.
%    
%    \TeX{} allocates space for different kinds of internal variables. 
%    Setting alignments needs lots of memory,
%    usually more than for typesetting plain text.
%    Thus, the parameter settings of a standard \TeX{} installation might not
%    be sufficient for certain projects. This manifests
%    in \TeX{} error messages about insufficient memory  
%    and the setting process is interrupted. There is no reason to be 
%    concerned. The parameters can be set by hand. Unfortunately, 
%    each \TeX{} system hides its default parameter file in a different
%    place in the system. 
%    
%    In the following, an excerpt from the FAQ-list to \TeXshade{} is added. 
%    This explains how 
%    to increase the settings in Oz\TeX{} for the Macintosh, Mik\TeX{} 
%    for Windows and te\TeX{} for *NIX \TeX{} distributions. Please contribute 
%    to this list!
%    
%    \begin{enumerate}
%    
%    \item
%    
%    \textbf{Oz\TeX{} 4.0 for the Macintosh:}
%    
%    Find the file `OzTeX:TeX:Configs:Default'. This file contains
%    all memory settings. Look for the section 
%    `\% TeX parameters' and increase the values that \TeX{} complains
%    about during the run. You will have to restart Oz\TeX{} before the
%    changes are active.
%    
%    For older versions of Oz\TeX{} the configuration file has the 
%    same name but the path is somewhat different.
%    
%    
%    \item
%    
%    \textbf{te\TeX{} for *NIX:} (contributed by Joerg Daehn)
%    
%    Find the file: `/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf' or use 
%    
%    |locate texmf.cnf| at the command prompt to find it.
%
%    Login as super user. Backup `texmf.cnf' in case you destroy something and
%    then open the `texmf.cnf' file in your favorite text editor and use its
%    search function to locate |main_memory|. This variable is set to 384000.
%    Change this to some higher value, i.e. 4000000 (works fine for me!). The
%    total amount of memory should not exceed 8000000, so check the other
%    values in that section. 
%
%    Next, you want to change the stack size. Search for |stack_size|. This
%    will be set to 300. I changed it to 4000 and it works fine.
%
%    There might be complains by \TeX{} about further specific parameters such
%    as |stack_size|. You find all those in the same file.
%
%    After this you have to run `texconfig init'.
%
%    Logout as root.
%
%    After this all should be set for large alignments. Happy \TeX{}ing!
%
%    The information on how to achieve this was derived from a mail in the
%    te\TeX{} mail archive. The original question was posted by Pascal Francq and
%    answered by Rolf Nieprasch.
%
%    
%    \item
%    
%    \textbf{MiK\TeX{} for Windows:}
%    
%    The MiK\TeX{} documentation describes very detailed how the memory
%    settings can be changed. In brief, you must locate the 
%    configuration file `miktex/config/miktex.ini'. In the [MiKTeX] 
%    section of this file you find all the parameters you need, e.\,g.\ 
%    |mem_min|, |mem_max|, |buf_size|, |stack_size| etc.
%    
%    It appears, that the standard settings of MiK\TeX{} are bigger 
%    than that of other \TeX{} installations, so it may not always be necessary 
%    to increase the values.
%    
%    
%    \end{enumerate}
%    
%    
%
%    \subsection{System requirements} \label{require}
%    
%    \TeXshade{} requires \LaTeXe{} with |color.sty| and |graphics.sty|
%    for shading. For arrows in the feature line (p.\pageref{Lfeature})  
%    the AMS Math style is needed.
%    David Carlisle's |color.sty| is part of the Standard \LaTeX{}
%    `Graphics Bundle' [1]. This and the other packages can be downloaded 
%    from any \TeX{} archive, e.g.\ |ftp.dante.de|; usually they are 
%    included in a comprehensive \TeX{} installation. 
%
%    The |color| style allows one to use several |[|\meta{options}|]|, e.\,g.
%    |dvips|, |pdftex| or |dviwin|. These provide the commands which
%    different devices/programs need to display colored output. It is 
%    advisable to make yourself familiar with the |color.sty| manual. 
%    You should define a default driver in the file |color.cfg|.
%    Since there is no direct call of |color.sty| by the user, the 
%    option can be stated when \TeXshade{} is loaded, see next 
%    subsection. If no option is stated the |DVIPS| driver will be 
%    loaded. 
%     
%    With the |[dvips]| option the output DVI-file 
%    can be converted to \textsc{PostScript} using the |DVIPS| program
%    and can later be viewed or printed with the public domain 
%    {\sc GhostView} program which is
%    available for almost all computer platforms. Further, more and more
%    standard \TeX{} viewers are to a certain extent \textsc{PostScript} 
%    compatible. 
%    \bigskip
%    
%    \subsection{The \texttt{texshade} environment}
%    
%    \label{tsenvironment}
%    
%    The commands provided by the \TeXshade{} package are enabled by
%    the following command in the document header section:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad |\usepackage[|\meta{option}|]{texshade}|
%    
%    \medskip
%    Make sure that the file `|texshade.sty|' is present in a directory
%    searched by \TeX{} (see the installation notes in the file
%    `|texshade.txt|').
%    
%    The \meta{option} given here is passed to |color.sty| which 
%    handles the color commands for a particular output device, see 
%    previous subsection and the |color.sty| manual.
%    
%    The \TeXshade{} package provides only one single new environment:
%    |texshade|. This environment has one mandatory and
%    one optional argument, both of them designating file names which
%    must be present in a directory searched by \TeX. The
%    required file \meta{alignmentfile} contains the aligned nucleotide 
%    or peptide sequences
%    (see section~\ref{alignfilestruc}). This file is needed, because 
%    \TeXshade{} does no alignment by 
%    itself, it has to take a preprocessed alignment as input.
%    The optional file is a parameter file (section~\ref{paramfilestruc})
%    with definitions for the
%    customized calculation of the consensus, special sequence features
%    or labels etc. In this parameter file all \TeXshade{} commands 
%    which are allowed in the |texshade| environment can be used and are 
%    fully functional.
%    Within the environment further \TeXshade{} commands can be given
%    to replace or complete settings from the parameter file.
%    
%    Thus, setting an alignment with \TeXshade{} is as simple as
%    this:
%    
%    \begin{quote}
%    |\begin{texshade}[|\meta{parameterfile}|]|
%         |{|\meta{alignmentfile}|}|
%         
%    \quad\emph{further \emph{\TeXshade} commands, if needed}
%    
%    |\end{texshade}|
%    \end{quote}
%    
%    \subsection{Shading modes predefined in this package}
%    
%    \subsubsection{Identity mode}
%    
%    \label{ident}
%     
%    This basic type of shading is provided by almost any alignment
%    program. All identical residues at a position are shaded if the
%    number of matching residues is higher than a given threshold
%    (default is 50\%).\medskip
%    
%    \begin{texshade}{AQPpro.MSF}
%       \setends{1}{80..112}
%       \hideconsensus
%    \end{texshade}
%
%    Code:\medskip
%
%    \vbox{%
%    \begin{verbatim}    
%    \begin{texshade}{AQPpro.MSF}
%       \setends{1}{80..112}
%       \hideconsensus
%    \end{texshade}
%    \end{verbatim}  
%    }  
%    
%    Quite uncommon for an alignment shading program is the possibility
%    to display only selected sequence domains, e.\,g.\ to eliminate uninteresting
%    positions from the output:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \begin{texshade}{AQPpro.MSF}
%       \setdomain{1}{80..90,100..110,120..130}
%       \showruler{1}{top}
%       \hidenumbering
%       \hideconsensus
%    \end{texshade}
%
%    Code:\medskip
%
%    \vbox{%
%    \begin{verbatim}

%    This goes even furher. You can have \TeXshade{} select positions

%    all residues that are within an 8 \AA{} radius around the
%    $\alpha$-carbon of the residue at position 81:

%    
%    If you like, positions where conservation is very high (here $\ge$ 80\%) can
%    be shaded in a special color and the consensus can be shown with
%    or without shading according to the degree of conservation:
%    \medskip\label{shadecons}

%    \end{verbatim}}
%    
%    \subsubsection{Similarity mode}
%    
%    \label{similar}
%    
%    In many cases it is expedient---mostly when comparing protein
%    sequences---to shade also residues
%    which are not identical but similar to the consensus sequence.
%    Consider a position where three out of five residues are basic
%    arginines and two more residues are also basic but lysines.
%    In similarity mode \TeXshade{} shades similar residues in a different 
%    color to distinguish them from the consensus residue. Even when 
%    none of the residues alone reaches the 
%    threshold but a group of similar residues does these are shaded
%    in the `similarity' color. This case is given for instance
%    when at a position in a five sequence alignment two aliphatic 
%    valines and two also aliphatic isoleucins are present and the 
%    threshold is set to 50\%. Neither residue exceeds this percentage 
%    but as a group of similars they do. 
%    
%    In grayscale printouts some colors of the following alignment may appear 
%    undistinguishable. Don't worry if you usually use grayscale---all 
%    colors/grays can be selected freely (see \ref{colors}).
%    \medskip

%    Probably you know 
%    this kind of shading from the public domain program 
%    |BoxShade| 
%    by \textsc{Kay Hofmann} or from the Macintosh version 
%    |MacBoxShade| by \textsc{Michael D. Barron}. \TeXshade{}
%    provides the same functionality---and goes truly beyond---for the 
%    \TeX{} community.

%    \subsubsection{T-Coffee shading}
%    
%    \label{TCoffee}
%    
%    \TeXshade{}'s capabilities of calculating alignment shadings are 
%    limited. |T-Coffee| (|www.tcoffee.org|) is a sophisticated alignment/shading 
%    software. You can apply shading from |T-Coffee| in \TeXshade{}
%    by loading the shading information file (|score_ascii|) generated by
%    |T-Coffee|.

%    
%    \label{diverse}
%    
%    Contrary to the above described modes this shading style displays
%    sequence differences. Thus, it is most suitable for comparing very
%    similar sequences, e.\,g.\ species variants of a protein.
%    
%    One sequence is used as consensus. 
%    Matching residues in other sequences are blanked out, 
%    mismatches are shown in lowercase.

%    
%    \label{func}
%    
%    Displaying functional peptide similarities is one of \TeXshade's
%    strong capabilities. Six functional shading modes are predefined;
%    further user specific modes can easily be created. The examples 
%    may not look very impressive when printed in grayscale. Enjoy 
%    them on your screen or use color printouts. As mentioned before,
%    all colors can be changed to others or to grays without restrictions
%    (see chapter \ref{colors}).

%    
%    Amino acid properties, such as hydrophobicity, molecular weight,

%    
%    To gain a quick overview of sequence similarities or properties 
%    the |\fingerprint| command has been implemented. It can depict the 
%    complete sequence in one single line. The residues are presented 
%    as colored vertical lines. The implementation of this kind of output
%    was inspired by a publication by \textsc{Kai-Uwe Fr\"ohlich} [6].

%    \subsection{Sequence logos}
%    
%    \label{logo}
%    
%    Sequence logos represent the information content of the aligned 
%    sequences at a position in bit (max.\ 2 bit for DNA, i.\,e.
%    log$_2$4, and 4.322 bit for proteins, i.\,e. log$_2$20) and the 
%    relative frequency of a base or amino acid at this 
%    position [7]. Thus, more information is contained in logos than in
%    a standard consensus sequence.
%    The example below shows a DNA sequence alignment with the logo on the  
%    top.
%
%    It must be remarked that a logo from only five sequences does not
%    produce meaningful results - it rather illustrates the technique.

%    The following output is derived from the calculation of a

%    subfamily compared to the remaining set of sequences. Here,
%    typical residues of AQP3 are shown (upright) which deviate 
%    from the remaining  four aquaporins of this alignment (upside-down).
%    The output can be directly compared to the sequence logo above,
%    which displays the same section of the alignment. 
%    Note, that five sequences are far too few to obtain meaningful
%    results with this method. This is just to illustrate the 
%    approach.

%    \subsection{Customization of the alignment output}
%    
%    Extensive possibilities are given to the user to customize 
%    the final output of an alignment. Thus, all parameters defining the
%    appearance of letters can be changed individually for sequence 
%    residues, names and numbering or the describing feature texts. 
%    Additional manual shading can be applied to any region or
%    block of residues. Sequences are easily re-ordered, separated, hidden 
%    or blanked out without recalculation of the entire alignment; 
%    sections of the alignment can also be shown. 
%    Numbering and rulers can be displayed and set to any value. 
%    A powerful tool is the |\feature|
%    command which allows one to label stretches of residues with bars, 
%    arrows, braces or any fill character and describing text. 
%    Legends are set automatically if desired, but user commands
%    are also provided to build individual legends.
%    
%    
%    \newpage
%    \section{Format of alignment input files}
%    
%    \label{alignfilestruc}
%    
%    \TeXshade{} can handle two common alignment input formats, i.\,e.\
%    the MSF format (\underline{m}ultiple \underline{s}equence 
%    \underline{f}ormat) and the ALN format 
%    (\underline{al}ig\underline{n}ment format). The MSF 
%    format is used by |PILEUP| of the Unix GCG sequence
%    analysis package\footnote{For a description see
%    |http://gene.md.huji.ac.il/Computer/GCG9doc|}. Files in the
%    ALN format are produced by |CLUSTAL| which is 
%    available for free for Unix, DOS and Macintosh. Further, upon 
%    request, the FASTA format is supported since version 1.6.
%    In addition to the mentioned software many alignment programs have 
%    export filters for the MSF, ALN or FASTA
%    format, e.\,g.\ |MACAW| produces ALN files. If
%    you are not sure whether your favorite sequence aligner 
%    produces one of the required formats compare its output to
%    the following examples. \TeXshade{} determines the format from
%    the internal file structure, thus extensions like MSF, ALN
%    or FASTA
%    are not required. If you can choose the alignment format 
%    MSF is recommended, because this format gives information
%    about the sequence type, i.\,e.\ peptide or nucleotide sequences, 
%    and length (for the correct setting of gaps at the sequence end).
%    
%    \subsection{The MSF file format}
%    Files of this type are divided into a header section and the 
%    multiple sequence alignment. The header may contain the
%    following components:
%    
%    
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item[\textbf{File Type}:] (optional) The first header line 
%              reads for nucleic acids alignments
%              |!!NA_MULTIPLE_ALIGNMENT 1.0| and for amino acid sequences
%              |!!AA_MULTIPLE_ALIGNMENT 1.0| (all uppercase).
%    \item[\textbf{Description}:] (optional) Informative text
%              describing what is in the file.
%    \item[\textbf{Dividing line}:] (required!) Must include the 
%              following attributes:
%       \begin{itemize}
%          \item[|MSF|:] Displays the number of bases or residues in 
%                        the multiple sequence alignment.
%          \item[|Type|:] Displays the sequence type, `P' for a peptide
%                         and `N' for a nucleotide alignment.
%          \item[|Checksum|:] Displays an integer value that 
%                        characterizes the contents of the file.
%          \item[|..|] The two periods act as a divider between the 
%                        descriptive information and the following
%                        sequence information.
%       \end{itemize}
%    \item[\textbf{Name/Weight}:] (required!) Must include the name of
%             each sequence included in the alignment, as well as its
%             length, checksum and weight.
%    \item[\textbf{Two slashes} (|//|):] (required!) This separating 
%             line divides the name/weight information from the 
%             sequence alignment
%    \end{itemize}
%    
%    The alignment section consists of sequence blocks divided by an
%    empty line. Each sequence line starts out with the sequence name.

%    \TeXshade{} extracts only the information from the file it
%    really needs. So, do not mind all the checksums listed
%    in the file---\TeXshade{} does not either. The same is true 
%    for |Weight|. Required are the string |MSF:| 
%    for the identification of the file format and |Type:| for the 
%    determination of the sequence type (both in the dividing line), 
%    further all |Name:| definitions and finally |//|. The MSF format 
%    allows one to comment out sequences. This is done 
%    by putting an exclamation point directly infront of the respective 
%    |Name|. These sequences are neither displayed nor used for the 
%    calculation of the consensus. This works for \TeXshade, too.
%    To comment out sequences without changing
%    the input file use the \TeXshade{} command 
%    |\killseq{|\meta{seqref}|}| (\ref{kill}).

%    The sequence lengths given after |Len:| are not used by 
%    \TeXshade. Due to the fact that most alignment programms calculate the 
%    sequence length by summing up residues and additionally gaps which 
%    is not really correct. In order to have the sequence break right 
%    after the last residue without printing further gap symbols 
%    \TeXshade{} counts the number of residues by itself. You can  
%    also use the command |\seqlength| in the \TeXshade{}
%    environment to set the values manually if you do not trust a machine.
%    
%    \subsection{The ALN file format}
%    ALN files are quite similar to the above described MSF files.
%    They simply lack a defined header section. Nevertheless, 
%    describing text is allowed before the alignment part. \TeXshade{}
%    determines the number of sequences and their names from the last
%    sequence block---so, no further text lines are allowed after this block!
%    Due to a lacking declaration in the file the sequence type has 
%    to be set in the |texshade| environment by |\seqtype{|\meta{type}|}|
%    \label{Lseqtype} with `P' for peptide and `N' for nucleotide sequences;
%    for the example below: |\seqtype{P}|. If no |\seqtype| command
%    is used \TeXshade{} assumes a nucleotide sequence.

%    generates a sequence name consisting of `|seq|' plus a consecutive

%    \section{Use of a \TeX{}shade parameter file}
%    
%    \label{paramfilestruc}
%    
%    Using predefined parameter files for repeatedly occuring situations
%    can save a lot of typing and makes the output throughout the 
%    publication or presentation more consistent. Further, such
%    files are an easy way to exchange self-defined shading 
%    modes or new color schemes (i.\,e.\ for a satisfying grayscale output) 
%    with other users. If you have created a
%    parameter file, which you think is of interest for others, please 
%    submit it to me\footnote{|ebeitz@pharmazie.uni-kiel.de|} as an e-mail 
%    attachment together with a short 
%    description. I will take care of those files and post them---with 
%    a reference to the author---together with the next \TeXshade{} 
%    distribution to make them available for all interested users.
%    
%    No special file format is required for parameter 
%    files. \TeXshade{} simply calls the file using the |\input|
%    command right after resetting all parameters to default. An
%    example parameter file is present containing the standard
%    parameters of \TeXshade{} called |texshade.def|. This file can be
%    changed freely and can be used as a template for the creation of
%    personal parameter files. 
%    
%    Five steps are executed by \TeXshade{} when 
%    processing the |texshade| environment:
%    
%    \bigskip
%    \begin{minipage}{12cm}
%    |\begin{texshade}[|\meta{parameterfile}|]{|\meta{alignmentfile}|}|
%    
%    \begin{enumerate}
%    \item Analysis of the \meta{alignmentfile}; determination of 
%    the number of sequences and sequence names
%    
%    \item Setting parameters to default
%    
%    \item Setting parameters to the definitions of the 
%    \meta{parameterfile}, if existent
%    
%    \item Execution of further \TeXshade{} commands within the
%    evironment, if existent
%    
%    \parindent-1cm
%    \medskip
%    |\end{texshade}|
%    
%    \parindent0cm
%    \item Loading and setting the alignment on a line by line basis
%    \end{enumerate}
%    \end{minipage}
%    
%    \newpage
%    \section{\texttt{texshade} user commands}
%    
%    The \TeXshade{} package must be loaded by the |\usepackage|
%    command in the document header section.
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\usepackage[|\meta{option}|]{texshade}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    Then, the |texshade| environment is ready to use as described
%    in \ref{tsenvironment}. See also section \ref{paramfilestruc} for
%    a description of the optional parameter file. All other 
%    commands provided by \TeXshade{} (except |\shadebox| [\ref{Lshadebox}], |\molweight| and
%    |\charge| [\ref{molcharge}], and |\percentsimilarity|, |\percentidentity| and
%    |\similaritytable| [\ref{Lpercentidentity}]) must 
%    be used within the |texshade| environment.
%    
%    
%    
%    \subsection{Using predefined shading modes}
%    
%    \label{predef}
%    
%    \label{Lshadingmode}
%    If no |\shadingmode| command is given in the |texshade| 
%    environment the default shading mode (\emph{identical}, see 
%    \ref{ident}) is active. For the selection of one of the other
%    predefined shading modes the following command is provided.
%    \bigskip
%    
%    \quad |\shadingmode[|\meta{option}|]{|\meta{mode}|}|
%    \bigskip
%    
%    You can choose from four shading modes and declare one option 
%    which depends on the selected mode. 
%    
%    \begin{enumerate}
%    
%    \item |\shadingmode[|\meta{allmatchspecial/number}|]{identical}|
%    
%       See \ref{ident} for examples. Use the
%       option |allmatchspecial| to shade positions with a special color
%       where all residues are identical. Or use a percentage number
%       (0--100) as an option to set an additional threshold for highly
%       conserved residues, e.\,g.\ |\shadingmode[90]{identical}|. 
%       \label{Lallmatchspecial}|\allmatchspecial| can also be 
%       used as a command with or without an optional parameter for
%       setting the high conservation threshold. As both, option or command, 
%       |allmatchspecial| is only active in the \emph{identical} and
%       \emph{similar} shading modes.
%       
%       \label{Lshadingcolors}
%       One can choose from five predefined shading color schemes with
%       the command 
%       |\shadingcolors{|\meta{scheme}|}|. The sets are named `blues' 
%       (used in the example, \ref{ident}), `reds', `greens', 
%       `grays' and `black'. Default is |\shadingcolors{blues}|. Further, the colors 
%       for the non matching, the 
%       conserved and all matching (or highly conserved) residues can be set individually 
%       plus the letter case (lower or upper) or any character
%       can be chosen: \label{Lnomatchresidues}
%       \label{Lconservedresidues}
%       \label{Lallmatchresidues} 
%       \bigskip
%       
%       |\nomatchresidues{|\meta{res.col.}|}{|\meta{shad.col.}|}{|\meta{case}|}{|\meta{style}|}|
%       
%       |\conservedresidues{|\meta{res.col.}|}{|\meta{shad.col.}|}{|\meta{case}|}{|\meta{style}|}|
%       
%       |\allmatchresidues{|\meta{res.col.}|}{|\meta{shad.col.}|}{|\meta{case}|}{|\meta{style}|}|
%       \bigskip
%       
%       For how to handle colors for the foreground \meta{res.col.} and 
%       the background \meta{shad.col.} see section \ref{colors}. 
%       The third parameter \meta{case} tells \TeXshade{} to print the
%       corresponding residue as a lowercase or an uppercase letter or
%       even to print any other character. Finally, the \meta{style} 
%       parameter tells \TeXshade{} which shape to use for the letters.
%       Use one of the following styles 
%       for \meta{style}.
%    
%       \begin{center}
%       \begin{tabular}{cl}
%       \meta{style} & \emph{effect} \\ \hline
%       |bf| & bold face series\\
%       |md| & normal series \\
%       |up| & upright shape (normal shape)\\
%       |it| & italics shape \\
%       |sl| & slanted shape \\
%       |rm| & modern roman family \\
%       |sf| & sans serif family \\
%       |tt| & typewriter family \\
%       \end{tabular}
%       \end{center}
%       \medskip    
%    
%       In order to change only some
%       of the parameters it is sufficient to declare these
%       and use empty braces for the others. Examples:
%       \bigskip
%       
%       \quad|\conservedresidues{White}{Blue}{upper}{bf}|: the conserved
%       residues are printed as bold face white uppercase letters on blue.
%       \bigskip
%       
%       \quad|\nomatchresidues{}{}{{$\bullet$}}{}|: instead of the non 
%       matching residues a `$\bullet$' is printed. The colors and style 
%       are not changed.
%       Note the double curly braces which make \TeXshade{} 
%       interpret this complex symbol description as one single 
%       character.
%
%       Once a set of shading colors is redefined, it can be saved using
%       |\defshadingcolors{|\meta{name}|}|\label{Ldefshadingcolors} for
%       later use in the document (see \ref{shaderegion}).
%
%       \bigskip
%       
%       
%    \item |\shadingmode[|\meta{allmatchspecial/number}|]{similar}|
%    
%       \label{Lsimilarresidues}
%       See \ref{similar} for an example output and an explanation
%       of the shading. In addition to the described commands
%       for changing shading colors this shading mode provides 
%       the command |\similarresidues|.
%       Use it in analogy to the commands above.
%       
%       \label{Lpepsims}\label{Lpepgroups}
%       \label{LDNAsims}\label{LDNAgroups}
%       How does \TeXshade{} know which residues are
%       considered to be similar? These definitions are set by two command
%       couples, i.\,e.\ 
%       |\pepsims|,|\pepgroups| for peptides and
%       |\DNAsims|,|\DNAgroups| for nucleotides. With |\pepsims| and
%       |\DNAsims| residues are defined which are similar to the 
%       consensus residue. Examples:
%       
%       \quad |\pepsims{S}{TA}|\quad If a serine is the consensus
%             residue then all threonins and alanines at this
%             position are shaded in the color for similars. This
%             definition does \emph{not} imply that threonine and
%             alanine are similar to each other! This becomes 
%             obvious when you inspect the next definition:
%             
%       \quad |\pepsims{T}{S}|\quad  Serine but not alanine is declared
%             to be similar to threonine.
%             
%       What happens if there is no consensus residue? How does
%       \TeXshade{} decide if a group of similars is greater than
%       the threshold? For this groups are pre-defined:
%       
%       \quad |\pepgroups{FYW,ILVM,RK,DE,GA,ST,NQ}| This command allows
%             one to set up to nine groups of similars, separated by commas. 
%             Each residue can belong to only one group. If one residue
%             is assigned to several groups only the last assignment is 
%             carried out.
%             
%       \quad |\DNAgroups{GAR,CTY}| This command is used in analogy to
%             the amino acid groups. Here, two ambiguity codes (`R' for
%             pu\underline{r}ine base and `Y' for p\underline{y}rimidine
%             base) are assigned in addition.
%             
%       Residues which do not appear in any of the four commands are 
%       considered not to belong to a group. The default 
%       settings for similars are listed below:
%       \bigskip
%       
%       \begin{verbatim}
% \pepgroups{FYW,ILVM,RK,DE,GA,ST,NQ}

%       After calling |\shadingmode{diverse}| these commands can be

%       curly braces around the dot-symbol!). 
%    
%       \label{Lhideallmatchpositions}
%       Since alignment positions where all residues match do not contain
%       much information, those sites can be blanked out using
%      |\hideallmatchpositions|. The resulting break in the alignment is
%       indicated by a gap and a vertical line. See the |\setdomain|

%       and \textsc{Ghandour} for peptide alignments [2] or by the
%       rasmol software. Additional 
%       `alphabets' to the standard 20-letter array of amino acids
%       can highlight peptide similarities which were otherwise not visible.
%       For the `alphabet' definitions see below:
%       
%       \begin{itemize}
%       \item \meta{type} = |charge|\quad Acidic (D, E) and basic (H, 
%                           K, R).
%    
%       \item \meta{type} = |hydropathy|\quad Acidic and basic (as 
%                           above), polar uncharged (C, G, N, Q, S, 
%                           T, Y) and hydrophobic nonpolar (A, F, I, L, M, 
%                           P, V, W), see also \textsc{Kyte} \& 
%                           \textsc{Doolittle} [3].
%    
%       \item \meta{type} = |structure|\quad External (D, E, H, K, N, Q, R),
%                           internal (F, I, L, M, V) and ambivalent (A, C,
%                           G, P, S, T, W, Y).
%       
%       \item \meta{type} = |chemical|\quad Acidic (D, E), aliphatic
%                           (I, L, V), aliphatic (small) (A, G), 
%                           amide (N, Q), aromatic
%                           (F, W, Y), basic (H, K, R), hydroxyl
%                           (S, T), imino (P) and sulfur (C, M).
%                           
%       \item \meta{type} = |rasmol|\quad (D, E), (K, R, H), (F, Y, W),
%                           (A, G), (C, M), (S, T), (N, Q), (I, L, V), 
%                           (P).
%                           
%       \end{itemize}
%                           
%       The two modes described below highlight sidechain sizes and 
%       hydrophobicity, respectively, according to \textsc{Rose} 
%       \emph{et al.}\ [4,5]. Standard area stands for the surface area
%       of the residue in \AA$^2$, i.\,e. it is a measure for the size
%       of a residue's sidechain. The accessible area value (also in 
%       \AA$^2$) gives information about the size of the surface area
%       which is accessible by solvent molecules within the folded 
%       protein. A very small area means that the residue is
%       strongly buried and is thus very hydrophobic. Hydrophilic
%       residues in turn possess large accessible areas due
%       to their prefered location at the protein surface. Therefore,
%       this kind of shading provides another method, in addition
%       to |hydropathy| and |structure|, for the
%       visualization of structural protein properties.
%       
%       \begin{itemize}
%       
%       \item \meta{type} = |standard area|\quad for the area values
%                           see legend of the alignment in \ref{starea}
%                           
%       \item \meta{type} = |accessible area|\quad for values see
%                           \ref{accarea}
%       
%       \end{itemize}
%       
%       \label{Lclearfuncgroups}
%       If no \meta{type} or an unknown \meta{type} is designated as option
%       all functional groups and shading colors are cleared. This is
%       also achieved by the command 
%       |\clearfuncgroups|. With all groups cleared one can start to
%       build new shading modes from scratch. How to do this is explained
%       in the next section.
%       
%    \label{Lfuncshadingstyle} 
%    In order to exchange the colors but to keep the group definitions
%    and descriptions the command 
%    |\funcshadingstyle| can be
%    employed. Usage:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\funcshadingstyle{|\meta{residue}|}{|\meta{res.col.}|}{|\meta{shad.col.}|}|
%    
%    \hfill|{|\meta{case}|}{|\meta{style}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    \meta{residue} is one representative of the whole amino acid group. The 
%    colors which are declared by the next four parameters are used 
%    for all residues in this group. \meta{case} and \meta{style} are 
%    as described for example in |\nomatchresidues|.
%    \end{enumerate}
%    
%       With |\shadeallresidues| \label{Lshadeallresidues} the 
%       threshold is ignored and
%       all residues are shaded due to their group assignment.
%
%    \subsection{Creating new functional shading modes}
%    
%    The grouping of amino acids due to other properties can make sense as
%    suggested by \textsc{Karlin} and \textsc{Ghandour} [2], e.\,g.\ 
%    physical properties (molecular weight, shape), kinetic properties
%    (reaction velocity, Michaelis-Menton constant), or structure
%    ($\alpha$-helices, $\beta$-sheets, turns).
%    
%    \label{Lfuncgroup}
%    New amino acid groups are defined with the
%    |\funcgroup| command. This command needs six parameters:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\funcgroup{|\meta{descr}|}{|\meta{residues}|}{|\meta{res.col.}|}{|\meta{shad.col.}|}|
%    
%    \hfill|{|\meta{case}|}{|\meta{style}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    \meta{descr} contains descriptive text which is displayed in the legend.
%    The second parameter \meta{residues} holds the amino acids to be
%    grouped. The colors for the foreground and background are set 
%    with the following two parameters, the case and style is declared by the 
%    last parameters. The example below defines a 
%    funcional group named `acidic ($-$)' containing the amino acids
%    aspartic and glutamic acid with white letters on a red background:
%    \bigskip
%    
%    \quad|\funcgroup{acidic ($-$)}{DE}{White}{Red}{upper}{up}|
%    \bigskip
%    
%    For the usage of colors see section \ref{colors}. Up to nine
%    individual groups can be defined. New groups are simply added to the
%    already existing groups, i.\,e.\ if an extension of the group
%    definitions of an existing shading mode is desired there is
%    no need to clear these groups und re-define them again. Just 
%    add the new groups with the |\funcgroup| command. To create 
%    completely new modes use the command
%    |\shadingmode{functional}| without an option 
%    \emph{before} setting the new groups. The new definitions are active
%    only in the functional shading mode---so be sure to
%    have it switched on before setting the new groups.
%    Remember, |\shadingmode{functional}| without an optional parameter
%    clears all groups defined before, see above. The following example
%    shows the definitions needed to produce an output which is identical 
%    to the functional mode `charge':
%    \bigskip
%    
%    \quad|\begin{texshade}{|\meta{alignmentfile}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad\quad |\shadingmode{functional}|
%    
%    \quad\quad |\funcgroup{acidic ($-$)}{DE}{White}{Red}{upper}{up}|
%    
%    \quad\quad |\funcgroup{basic ($+$)}{HKR}{White}{Blue}{upper}{up}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\end{texshade}|
%    
%    
%    \subsection{Appearance of the consensus line}
%    
%    \label{Lthreshold}
%    An important parameter for the calculation of the consensus is the
%    threshold percentage. Default setting is 50\%, i.\,e.\ to become
%    the consensus residue more than half of the residues at this
%    position must be identical or similar, depending on the shading
%    mode. Any percentage between 0 and 100 is allowed and can be 
%    set with 
%    |\threshold{|\meta{percentage}|}|, e.\,g.\ |\threshold{50}|.
%
%    Additionally, an optional parameter can be set, e.\,g.\,
%    |\threshold[90]{50}|, to label residues that are highly conserved
%    in a special color (see example on page \pageref{ident}).
%    
%    \label{Lconstosingleseq}
%    Another possibility is to set one sequence of the alignment
%    as consensus and 
%    compare the other sequences to this one. Therefore, the
%    command 
%    |\constosingleseq{|\meta{seqref}|}| is provided. The
%    \meta{seqref} selects the sequence to be used as consensus
%    (numbering according to the appearance in the alignment file;
%    top sequence is number~1, or use the sequence name). 
%    Nevertheless, the threshold percentage is also taken into 
%    account, i.\,e.\ with a threshold of 50\% half
%    of the sequences must be identical or similar compared to the 
%    specified consensus sequence in order to be shaded.
%    \label{Lconstoallseqs} With |\constoallseqs| the 
%    consensus is calculated considering all sequences (the case 
%    described in the paragraph above).
%    
%    \label{Lshowconsensus}\label{Lhideconsensus}
%    \label{Lnameconsensus}
%    Consensus lines are displayed either on the top or at the bottom
%    of the alignment by calling 
%    \medskip
%
%    |\showconsensus[|\meta{color/scale}|[,|\meta{color/scale}|]]{|\meta{position}|}| 
%    \medskip
%
%    with 
%    \meta{scale} |Gray|, |BlueRed|, |RedBlue|, |GreenRed|, |RedGreen|,
%    |ColdHot| (recommended), |HotCold|, or |T-Coffee| \ref{TCoffee}, and \meta{position} |top| 
%    or |bottom|. 
%
%    The first color defines the foreground, i.e. the letters, the
%    second color---if specified---defines the background. 
%    If a color scale is named the consensus will be shaded according
%    to the level of sequence conservation (see section \ref{resweight} on residue 
%    weight tables below). For an example output see page
%    \pageref{shadecons}. You can find more information on color scales 
%    on page \pageref{Lgraphs}. The calculated consensus colors can be exported
%    as a Pymol [8] \label{Lexportconsensus}
%    script by |\exportconsensus[|\meta{filename}|]{|\meta{seqref}|}|.
%    If no \meta{filename} is specified |export.txt| will be used. The 
%    generated file can be opened in Pymol in order to shade a 3D model
%    of the sequence \meta{seqref}.
%
%    To hide the consensus use 
%    |\hideconsensus|. The consensus
%    line is named `consensus' in english texts, `consenso' in spanish
%    or `Konsensus' if the |german.sty| is used. With 
%    |\nameconsensus{|\meta{name}|}| any name can be set.
%    
%    \label{Ldefconsensus} 
%    You can tell \TeXshade{} which symbols or letters to use in
%    the consensus line for different matching qualities by 
%    \bigskip
%    
%    \quad|\defconsensus{|\meta{symbol1}|}{|\meta{symbol2}|}{|\meta{symbol3}|}|.
%    \bigskip
%    
%    The following parameters are allowed for symobols 1--3:
%    
%    \begin{enumerate}
%    
%    \item \meta{symbol1} = no match symbol (if below threshold)
%    
%          \begin{itemize}
%             \item any character or letter
%             \item |{}| (empty braces) for blank space
%          \end{itemize}
%          
%    \item \meta{symbol2} = conserved symbol (if threshold is exceeded)
%    
%          \begin{itemize}
%             \item |upper| (prints the consensus residue in uppercase)
%             \item |lower| (prints the consensus residue in lowercase)
%             \item any character or letter
%             \item |{}| (empty braces) for blank space
%          \end{itemize}
%          
%    \item \meta{symbol3} = highly conserved symbol (if
%
%                                 \hfill|\allmatchspecial| is active)
%    
%          \begin{itemize}
%             \item see \meta{symbol2}
%          \end{itemize}
%    
%    \end{enumerate}
%    
%    Example: |\defconsensus{{}}{*}{upper}| does not show non matching
%    residues in the consensus line, marks conserved residues 
%    with `|*|', and displays the uppercase letter of the consensus
%    residue at positions with high conservation.
%    
%    
%    \label{Lconsensuscolors}
%    Finally, the colors of the above defined symbols are adjustable
%    by the command: 
%    
%    \begin{tabbing}
%    \quad|\consensuscolors|\=|{|\meta{res.col.1}|}{|\meta{shad.col.1}|}|\\
%    
%    \>|{|\meta{res.col.2}|}{|\meta{shad.col.2}|}|\\
%    
%    \>|{|\meta{res.col.3}|}{|\meta{shad.col.3}|}|\\
%    \end{tabbing}
%    
%    The color definitions are in the same order as in the
%    |\defconsensus| command:
%    
%    \begin{enumerate}
%    
%    \item \meta{res.col.1} = no match residue color (if below threshold)
%    
%          \meta{shad.col.1} = no match background color 
%          
%    \item \meta{res.col.2} = conserved residue color (if threshold is exceeded)
%    
%          \meta{shad.col.2} = conserved background color 
%          
%    \item \meta{res.col.3} = highly conserved residue color (if 
%
%                                 \hfill|\allmatchspecial| is active)
%    
%          \meta{shad.col.3} = highly conserved background color 
%    
%    \end{enumerate}
%    
%    For colors which are not to be changed empty braces can be used.
%    
%    Example:\medskip
%    
%    \quad|\consensuscolors{}{}{Blue}{White}{Red}{Green}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    Non matching symbol colors are not changed, 
%    conserved residues are displayed blue on white and highly conserved residues
%    appear as red symbols on a green background in the 
%    consensus line.
%    
%    
%    \subsubsection{Residue weight tables} \label{resweight}
%    
%    The degree of similarity between two amino acid residues is defined using
%    so-called \emph{residue weight tables}. The values usually range roughly
%    from $-10$ to 10, with positive values denoting similarity and negative
%    values dissimilarity. The most simple table sets pairs
%    of identical residues to a value of 10 and all others to 0, i.e. the
%    |identity| matrix. Several more matrices based on extensive protein alignments
%    exist and can be used, e.g. |PAM250| (|Point Accepted Mutations|), |PAM100|,
%    or |BLOSUM62| (|BLOcks of amino acid SUbstitution Matrix|); for details see
%    respective sources and section \ref{weightmatrix}. \TeXshade{} further contains a 
%    |structural| matrix where 
%    similarity is defined on simple comparisons of the sidechain properties with
%    respect to volume and hydropathy.
%    
%    For calculation of the consensus color shading or for bar graphs or color scales
%    in the |\feature| lines (\ref{Lfeature}), a residue weight table can be selected
%    by \label{Lweighttable} |\weighttable{|\meta{table}|}| with \meta{table}
%    being |identity|, |structural|, |PAM250|, |PAM100|, or |BLOSUM62| (default is
%    |identity|). Which matrix suits the analysis best needs to be decided case by case.
%    Due to the all-positive values of the |structural| matrix (section \ref{weightmatrix}) the similarity level
%    appears usually very high; the |identity| matrix simply represents the number
%    of identical residues at each position. The |PAM| and |BLOSUM| matrices provide
%    more differentiated results.
%    One can change individual values or even define his own weight table
%    using the command \label{Lsetweight} 
%    |\setweight{|\meta{res.1}|}{|\meta{res.2}|}{|\meta{value}|}|, e.g.
%    |\setweight{E}{Q}{2}| or |\setweight{K}{C}{-5}|. A full table, thus, needs 200
%    entries ($20 * 20 / 2$). \label{Lgappenalty}
%    A value for the gap penalty is set with |\gappenalty{|\meta{value}|}|.
%    
%    \subsection{Display of logos}
%    
%    \subsubsection{Sequence logos}
%    
%    \label{Lshowsequencelogo}\label{Lhidesequencelogo}
%    In a sequence logo [7], the information content $I(P_i)$ of 
%    each alignment position $i$ is defined as 
%
%    \[ 
%    I(P_i) = \log_2 \vert\Sigma\vert + \sum P_{ij} \cdot \log_2 P_{ij}
%    \]
%
%    \noindent
%    with $\vert\Sigma\vert$ being the cardinality of the used alphabet, 
%    i.\,e. 4 for DNA and 20 for protein sequences, and $P_{ij}$ 
%    being the frequency of residue $j$ at this position. Each position 
%    is displayed as a stack of residue symbols whose heights 
%    represent their proportion of the information content (example on
%    p.\pageref{logo}).
%
%    The display of sequence logos can be either on the top or at the bottom
%    of a nucleotide or protein alignment. Logos will be shown after the
%    command: |\showsequencelogo[|\meta{colorset}|]{|\meta{top/bottom}|}|. If no optional
%    \meta{colorset} is selected the residues will be shaded as follows:\medskip
%
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item Nucleotide sequences
%
%    \begin{itemize}
%      \item[G]: Black
%      \item[A]: Green
%      \item[T,U]: Red
%      \item[C]: Blue
%    \end{itemize}
%    
%
%    \item Protein sequences (similar to rasmol)
%
%    \begin{itemize}
%      \item[D,E]: Red
%      \item[C,M]: Yellow
%      \item[K,R]: Blue
%      \item[S,T]: Orange
%      \item[F,Y]: MidnightBlue
%      \item[N,Q]: Cyan
%      \item[G]:   LightGray
%      \item[L,V,I]: Green
%      \item[A]: DarkGray
%      \item[W]: CarnationPink
%      \item[H]: CornflowerBlue
%      \item[P]: Apricot
%      \item[B,Z]: LightMagenta
%    \end{itemize}
%    \end{itemize}
%    
%    Optional color sets correspond to the functional shading modes
%    |chemical|, |rasmol|, |hydropathy|, |structure|, |standard area|, 
%    |accessible area| (see p.\pageref{funcdef}). The |\showsequencelogo| 
%    command can be reversed by |\hidesequencelogo|.
%
%    \label{Llogocolor}\label{Lclearlogocolors}
%    Logo colors can be turned to `Black' with the command
%    |\clearlogocolors[|\meta{color}|}| with the optional parameter
%    not set. The optional parameter can be used to set all 
%    residue colors to \meta{color}, e.g.\ |\clearlogocolors[Blue]|.
%    User specific logo color sets are defined by using
%    |\logocolor{|\meta{residues}|}{|\meta{color}|}|, e.g.\ 
%    |\logocolor{DE}{Red} \logocolor{CM}{Yellow}| etc.
%
%    \label{Ldofrequencycorrection}\label{Lundofrequencycorrection}
%    It is common practice for protein sequence logos to correct
%    amino acid frequencies to the background frequency in the
%    alignment, which usually differs from the equal distribution
%    of 5\% for each residue. Frequency correction can be turned on
%    by |\dofrequencycorrection| and off by |\undofrequencycorrection|.
%
%    \label{Llogostretch}The vertical extent of the logo can be changed by 
%    |\logostretch{|\meta{factor}|}|, e.g.\ |\logostretch{1.5}|.
%    The width of the logo characters is dependent on the character
%    width set for the alignment, see |\charstretch| on p.\pageref{Lcharstretch}.
%
%    \label{Lshowlogoscale}\label{Lhidelogoscale}Finally, the bit-scale 
%    can be turned off and on using |\hidelogoscale| and
%    |\showlogoscale[|\meta{color}|]{|\meta{position}|}|, respectively, with
%    \meta{position} |left|, |right|, or |leftright| and an optional
%    \meta{color}. 
%    \label{Lnamesequencelogo}
%    A name for the sequence logo can be set, which is displayed
%    next to the scale by |\namesequencelogo{|\meta{name}|}|.
%
%
%    \subsubsection{Subfamily logos}
%
%    Subfamily logos provide a novel tool to visualize
%    subfamily-specific sequence deviations at alignment positions with
%    a high information content in an intuitive way [14].
%
%    This is achieved by subtracting from the frequency of a residue within 
%    a pre-defined subset of sequences, i.\,e. a subfamily, the frequency of 
%    this residue in the remaining set of sequences. The difference is then 
%    weighted by the information content, see above section on sequence logos.
%    An example is shown on p.\pageref{sublogo}.
%
%    Subtraction of frequencies produces values from $-1$ to $1$. Positive 
%    values correspond to residues which are characteristic for the subfamily 
%    (shown upright in the output), negative values to those that are typical 
%    for the remaining sequences (shown upside-down). Positions with an equal 
%    distribution of the residue result in a zero value. 
%
%    \label{Lshowsubfamilylogo}\label{Lhidesubfamilylogo}\label{Lsetsubfamily}
%    Subfamily logos are displayed analogous to sequence logos by the command 
%    |\showsubfamilylogo[|\meta{colorset}|]{|\meta{top/bottom}|}| and hidden by
%    |\hidesubfamilylogo|. To calculate a subfamily logo, it is further required
%    to define a subfamily within the alignment by 
%    |\setsubfamily{|\meta{seqrefs}|}|, e.g. |\setsubfamily{1-10,20,AQP3}|. 
%
%    For coloring residues, display/stretching of the scales, and frequency 
%    correction the same commands as for sequence logos apply with two exceptions.
%    \label{Lshownegatives}\label{Lhidenegatives}
%    First, subfamily logos contain negative values, which can be displayed
%    |\shownegatives[|\meta{weak, medium, strong}|]| or hidden 
%    |\hidenegatives|. Without the optional parameter negative residues will
%    be tinted by 50\%, i.e. |medium|. This greatly improves readability. 
%    \label{Lnamesubfamilylogo}
%    Second, a name for the subfamily logo is set by 
%    |\namesubfamilylogo[|\meta{neg.name}|]{|\meta{pos.name}|}| with a required
%    name for the positive part of the logo and an optional name for the negative
%    part.
%
%    \label{Lrelevance}\label{Lshowrelevance}\label{Lhiderelevance}
%    In order to better recognize relevant positions in the subfamily logo, a 
%    bit-value can be set above which the deviation is considered relevant
%    by the command |\relevance{|\meta{bit-value}|}|. If this command is
%    not given 2.321\,bit is assumed for proteins, i.\,e.
%    $\log_2 5$, and 1\,bit for DNA, i.\,e. $\log_2 2$. Such positions will 
%    be labeled by 
%    |\showrelevance[|\meta{color}|]{|\meta{symbol}|}|, e.\,g.
%    |\showrelevance[Blue]{$\nabla$}|. The symbol will be hidden with
%    |\hiderelevance|. 
%
%    \subsection{Appearance of the sequence lines}
%    
%    \label{seqlines}
%    
%    \subsubsection{Names, numbers and gaps}
%     \label{Lshownames}\label{Lshownumbering}
%    Many parameters that influence the appearance of the actual sequence
%    lines can be changed for customization.
%    Thus, the sequence names can be shown colored via \meta{color}
%    either left or right by
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\shownames[|\meta{color}|]{|\meta{position}|}|
%    \medskip
%
%    with \meta{position} set to |left| or |right|. The numbering can be
%    displayed either left or right and even on both sides by
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\shownumbering[|\meta{color}|]{|\meta{position}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    with \meta{position} |left|, |right| or |leftright|. Both,  
%    names and numbering can be displayed on the same side.     
%    \label{Lnamescolor}\label{Lnumberingcolor}    
%    The colors can also be set with |\namescolor{|\meta{color}|}| and 
%    |\numberingcolor{|\meta{color}|}|, respectively. 
%
%    \label{Lnameseq}
%    \TeXshade{} uses the sequence names from the 
%    alignment input file. This can cause some
%    problems during the \TeX-run when special characters are present
%    in those names! \TeXshade{} does not accept the following characters
%    in sequence names: |\ { } @| spaces and the tilde. Those have to be replaced in 
%    the input file. The characters |#| and |%| can only be used with a
%    leading backslash, e.\,g. |\#|. This must also be changed in the
%    input file. All other special characters should be displayed 
%    properly.    
%    
%    Sequence names that are accepted by \TeXshade{} can further be
%    changed in the |texshade| environment: 
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\nameseq{|\meta{seqref}|}{|\meta{name}|}| 
%    \medskip
%    
%    \meta{seqref} selects the sequence whose name is to be changed. 
%    The basis for the \meta{seqref} is the appearance in
%    the alignment input file with the top sequence = 1, or the old 
%    name. 
%    \label{Lnamecolor}\label{Lnumbercolor}    
%    In order to change the colors only of some sequence names or numbers 
%    the commands 
%    |\namecolor{|\meta{seq1}|, ... ,|\meta{seq n}|}{|\meta{color}|}| and 
%    |\numbercolor{|\meta{seq1}|, ... ,|\meta{seq n}|}{|\meta{color}|}| 
%    are provided.
%    
%    \label{Lhidenames}\label{Lhidename}
%    \label{Lhidenumbering}\label{Lhidenumber}
%     In order to hide all names or the numbering use the command
%     |\hidenames| or |\hidenumbering|. If only the names or numbers of
%     some sequences should be hidden apply 
%     
%     |\hidename{|\meta{seq1}|, ... ,|\meta{seq n}|}| or
%     
%     |\hidenumber{|\meta{seq1}|, ... ,|\meta{seq n}|}|, respectively.
%    
%    \label{Lstartnumber} \label{Lallowzero} \label{Ldisallowzero}
%    In some situations, e.\,g.\ when only sections of sequences are 
%    displayed, one
%    may not want to have the residue numbering start out with number~1.
%    The command 
%    |\startnumber[|\meta{start..stop}|]{|\meta{seqref}|}{|\meta{startnumber}|}|
%    allows one to set the starting number of any sequence to any value
%    incl.\ negative values but except `0' which is not usually used in
%    sequence numbering (the transition from negative to positive
%    values is like this: \ldots\ $-2$, $-1$, 1, 2 \ldots). If, however,
%    the use of the number `0' is wanted as sometimes in sequence logos
%    this can be turned on by |\allowzero| and off with |\disallowzero|.
%    The optional parameter can be used to truncate the sequence display
%    to a certain section (see also |\setends| below). 
%    
%    \label{Lseqlength}
%    \TeXshade{} needs to know the correct length of the sequences
%    to be able to break them right after the last residue. If
%    MSF files are used as an input the length is already given
%    but the calculation is usually wrong because the gaps are
%    also counted. Thus, \TeXshade{} counts the number of residues
%    during each run by itself and stores the values in the |.aux| file. That
%    means that it needs two runs to get the numbers right. Again,
%    this is only important if the gap symbol after the sequence end
%    should be suppressed, see below (|\hideleadinggaps|).
%    
%    If you know the correct length of the sequences you can use the
%    command 
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\seqlength{|\meta{seqref}|}{|\meta{length}|}| 
%    \medskip
%    
%    in order to set the values by hand and have the gaps break 
%    properly already in the first \TeX{} run.
%    \medskip
%    
%    Example: |\seqlength{1}{346}| means that sequence no.~1 is 346 
%    residues long.
%    
%    
%     \label{Lshowruler}\label{Lhideruler}
%     \label{Lrulersteps}\label{Lrulercolor}
%     \label{Lrotateruler}\label{Lunrotateruler}
%     \label{Lnamerulerpos}\label{Lrulerspace}
%     Another possibility to label sequence positions is to switch
%    on a ruler on the top or at the bottom of the sequence block
%    using \label{ruler}
%    |\showruler[|\meta{color}|]{|\meta{position}|}{|\meta{seqref}|}|. 
%    The residue ruler of one sequence \meta{seqref} or the consensus 
%    (declare `|consensus|' as \meta{seqref}) can be 
%    displayed at \meta{position} |top| or |bottom|.
%    The ruler is hidden with  |\hideruler|. The steps between two
%    numbers are set by |\rulersteps{|\meta{number}|}|. If the steps
%    are set to be very close ($< 4$) or when every position is numbered, the
%    numbering is automatically rotated by 90$^\circ$. Using |\rotateruler|
%    and |\unrotateruler| this can be done and undone manually. 
%    In order to change the
%    ruler color use the optional parameter or the command 
%    |\rulercolor{|\meta{color}|}|. Also, the label and its color at individual 
%    ruler positions can be changed by the user to a string using 
%    |\namerulerpos{|\meta{number}|}{|\meta{text}|[|\meta{color}|]}| 
%    (see example on p.\ \pageref{ras}). Finally, to adjust the distance
%    between the ruler and the top or bottom sequence row use
%    |\rulerspace{|\meta{length}|}|, e.\,g. |\rulerspace{1mm}|.
%    
%    \label{Lgapchar}\label{Lgaprule}
%    \label{Lgapcolors}\label{gapchar}
%    Further, the symbol which is displayed in sequence gaps is freely 
%    selectable with  
%    |\gapchar{|\meta{symbol}|}|. \meta{symbol} can be any character
%    or symbol. If math symbols are to be used math mode must be
%    activated by |$| characters, i.\,e. |\gapchar{{$\triangle$}}|.
%    Note the double curly braces in the last command. Everytime a
%    `complex' character is used, i.\,e. a character definition consisting 
%    of more than one letter, it must be braced in order to be interpreted as one 
%    character. One exception is |\gapchar{rule}|; with this 
%    parameter lines are drawn in the sequence gaps with a certain 
%    thickness defined by |\gaprule{|\meta{thickness}|}|, e.\,g.
%    |\gaprule{1.5pt}|. The colors of the gaps and gap symbols are set by 
%    |\gapcolors{|\meta{symbol color}|}{|\meta{background color}|}|.
%    
%    There are some discussions whether or not to display gap symbols before
%    and after the actual sequence. Since v1.3a one can control the
%    appearance of those gap symbols by the commands
%    \label{Lshowleadinggaps} \label{Lhideleadinggaps}
%    |\showleadinggaps| and |\hideleadinggaps|. By default, leading 
%    gaps are indicated by symbols despite my personal
%    thinking that it could suggest that 
%    there are some not displayed residues upstream resp.\ downstream of the 
%    gap.
%    
%    At certain instances a protein alignment input file may contain stop 
%    positions, e.\,g. due to frame shifts in the underlying DNA sequence.
%    If such positions are labeled in the input with an |*| this will be 
%    shown in the output as well as an asterisk, i.\,e. distinguishable from
%    a normal gap symbol. The character shown at stop positions can be
%    changed by |\stopchar{|\meta{symbol}|}|. \label{Lstopchar}
%    
%    \subsubsection{Displaying selected residues in the alignment}
%    
%    \label{Lsetends}
%    \TeXshade{} can display a section of the complete alignment
%    without the need to edit the alignment input file or even 
%    to re-calculate
%    the entire alignment. This allows one to use one single 
%    alignment of the full length proteins or open reading frames for
%    multiple visualizations of different sections in a document as
%    done in this manual. Thus, the file |AQPpro.MSF| contains
%    the full-length multiple protein alignment of five aquaporins but
%    only sections are displayed as examples in 
%    \ref{ident} through \ref{accarea}. The definition of a section
%    is done by  
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\setends[|\meta{startnumber}|]{|\meta{seqref}|}{|\meta{start..stop}|}|.
%    \medskip
%    
%    Again, \meta{seqref} is the sequence number based on the 
%    appearance in the alignment file, or the name; further, in order to use
%    the consensus as a measure for the sequence section the
%    string `|consensus|' as \meta{seqref} is accepted. The 
%    specified sequence is truncated at
%    positions \meta{start} and \meta{stop}. All other 
%    sequences are cut accordingly. If the number of the first
%    residue in the sequence is set to a new value with the 
%    |\startnumber| command (s.\,a.) this is taken into account. The 
%    \meta{startnumber} can be set as an optional parameter directly
%    in the |\setends| command as well.
%    \medskip
%
%    Some examples:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad a) |\setends{1}{21..100}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad b) |\startnumber{1}{101} \setends{1}{121..200}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    Both commands select the same sequence section from the alignment but
%    numbering for sequence 1 starts at position~21 in the first example and at 
%    position~121 in the latter.
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad c) |\setends[101]{1}{121..200}| equals example b.
%    \medskip
%    
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad d) |\startnumber[121..200]{1}{101}| also equals example b.
%    \medskip
%    
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad e) |\setends{consensus}{21..100}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    This may describe a very different section of the multiple
%    sequence alignment because the consensus counts every position
%    including gaps.
%    
%    \label{Lsetdomain}
%    The output can be even further restricted to
%    individually selected residues, e.g.\ to eliminate uninteresting alignment stretches or
%    to condense the output, by:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\setdomain{|\meta{seqref}|}{|\meta{selection}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    Here, \meta{seqref} denotes the reference sequence by its number or name.
%    This sequence is used to define the alignment positions \meta{selection} 
%    to be shown. 
%    \meta{selection} can have two different formats
%    depending on whether (a) the user wants to select the positions manually
%    or (b) \TeXshade{} is supposed to select the residues based on 3D
%    coordinates provided by a PDB file.
%    
%    To select the residues manually, the user provides a position list of
%    the following format:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|{|\meta{start1}..\meta{stop1}|,|\meta{start2}..\meta{stop2}|,|\ldots|,|\meta{start n}..\meta{stop n}|}|
%    \medskip
%
%    For how to select positions by 3D coordinates
%    provided by a PDB file, see \ref{Lshaderegion}. 
%    \medskip
%    
%    Examples (see also p.\,\pageref{ident}ff):
%
%    \quad|\setdomain{1}{20..80}|
%    
%    \quad|\setdomain{consensus}{20..80,100..150,200..220}|
%    
%    \quad|\setdomain{AQP1}{point[6]:1FX8.pdb,173[side]}|
%    
%    \quad|\setdomain{3}{plane[0.5]:1JN4.pdb,66[CA],73[side],199[CA]}|
%    \medskip
%
%    
%    It is helpful to show a ruler (probably single-stepped, see p.\,\pageref{Lshowruler}) to 
%    label the residue positions. 
%    
%    The resulting gaps between sequence stretches are marked by a vertical rule, which
%    can be changed in thickness by 
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad|\domaingaprule{|\meta{thickness}|}|, e.\,g.\
%    |\domaingaprule{1pt}|. \label{Ldomaingaprule}
%    \medskip
%
%    Also, the colors can be set by 
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad|\domaingapcolors{|\meta{foreground}|}{|\meta{background}|}| \label{Ldomaingapcolors}
%    \medskip
%
%     e.\,g.\ |\domaingapcolors{Blue}{Yellow}|.
%    
%    
%    \subsubsection{Hiding, killing, separating and ordering}
%    
%    \label{kill}
%    
%    \label{Lhideseq}\label{Lhideseqs}\label{Lshowseqs}\label{Lkillseq}
%    If one or more sequences from the alignment input file should be used for
%    the calculation of the consensus but it is desired not to
%    display these sequences in the final output use the command 
%    |\hideseq{|\meta{seq1}|,|\meta{seq2}|,|\ldots|,|\meta{seq n}|}|. 
%    For consecutive sequence numbers a dash can be used, e.\,g. 
%    |\hideseq{1-3}| instead of |\hideseq{1,2,3}|. Decending series 
%    are also permitted, e.\,g. |\hideseq{3-1}|.
%    This command allows one for example to hide 
%    the sequence which has been defined as the consensus sequence
%    with |\constosingleseq|. When all sequences should be hidden, e.g. to
%    show a sequence logo alone, one can simply say |\hideseqs|. This
%    command is reversed by |\showseqs|.
%
%    In order to completely exclude sequences the command 
%    |\killseq{|\meta{seq1}|,|\meta{seq2}|,|\ldots|,|\meta{seq n}|}| is 
%    provided. Again, for number series the dash can be used (s.\,a.). The 
%    designated sequences are neither displayed nor
%    considered for the calculation of the consensus. This is
%    another possibility to comment out sequences in addition
%    to the use of an exclamation point infront of the |Name:|
%    definition in an MSF-file (see figure on page \pageref{commout}).
%    
%    \label{Ldonotshade}
%    The command 
%    |\donotshade{|\meta{seq1}|,|\meta{seq2}\ldots|,|\meta{seq n}|}| 
%    makes 
%    one or more sequences (remember the dash, s.\,a.) appear unshaded 
%    in black letters on white background.
%    This does not influence any other sequences or the consensus
%    calculation.
%    
%    \label{Lhideresidues}\label{Lshowresidues}
%    If a very graphical output of the sequences is desired, the 
%    residue symbols or letters can be blanked out by
%    |\hideresidues|. Now, only the shaded boxes are printed. 
%    In combination with |\gapchar{rule}| one obtains alignments
%    in a style \`a la Mondrian.
%    The residues reappear with |\showresidues|.
%    
%    \label{Lseparationline}\label{Lsmallsep}
%    \label{Lmedsep}\label{Lbigsep}
%    \label{Lvsepspace}
%    If an alignment contains members of several subgroups of a
%    protein or a gene family it may be rather helpful to visualize the group
%    divisions by a separation line. Therefore, the command
%    |\separationline{|\meta{seqref}|}| is applicable. This 
%    command inserts vertical space after the sequence which is
%    refered to by \meta{seqref}. How much space is inserted
%    is defined by one of the following commands: 
%    |\smallsep|, |\medsep| (default) or |\bigsep|. These lengths
%    correspond to the known |\small|-, |\med|- and |\bigskip| commands. 
%    With |\vsepspace{|\meta{length}|}| any length with any
%    \TeX{} unit can be assigned, e.\,g. |\vsepspace{2mm}|.
%    
%    \label{Lorderseqs}
%    The sequence order given by the alignment input file is easily
%    reorganized by 
%    |\orderseqs{|\meta{seq1}|,|\meta{seq2}|,|\ldots|,|\meta{seq n}|}|
%    without the need for editing the alignment input file (which 
%    would be a big copy'n'paste job).
%    Make sure that all sequences are assigned in this
%    command. If there are more sequences present than numbers or names in the
%    command an error message will occur. Here also, the dash can be 
%    used for sequence number series. Example: |\orderseqs{1-3,6-4,7}| 
%    is equivalent to |\orderseqs{1,2,3,6,5,4,7}|.
%    Reordering of sequences only changes the output; all commands using
%    the parameter \meta{seqref} are not influenced, because \meta{seqref} 
%    always corresponds to the appearance in the alignment file. Thus, 
%    to completely reverse the order of a five sequence alignment simply type 
%    |\orderseqs{5-1}|.
%    
%    
%    \subsubsection{Residues per line and further settings}
%    
%    \label{Lresiduesperline}\label{Lresiduesperline*}
%    By default \TeXshade{} puts the highest possible by five 
%    divisible number of residues in one line depending on the 
%    |\linewidth|. With |\residuesperline{|\meta{number}|}| a new 
%    value can be set. If this value exceeds the highest possible 
%    number of residues per line it is ignored; lower values are
%    accepted of course. But also in the latter case the number
%    of residues printed per line is rounded such to be divisible by five. 
%    To force \TeXshade{}
%    to set lines with exactly the desired number of residues use
%    the asterisk-extended command |\residuesperline*{|\meta{number}|}|. 
%    You have to take care yourself of the alignment width after this command, 
%    because in this mode \TeXshade{} does not check the length of the 
%    lines any more.
%    
%    \label{Lcharstretch}\label{Llinestretch}
%    \TeXshade{} calculates the dimensions of a shaded box from
%    the width and height of the uppercase letter `M' and the depth of
%    the lowercase `g'. Depending on the font used for the
%    sequence residues the box dimensions might not be fully
%    satisfactory. With |\charstretch{|\meta{factor}|}| and
%    |\linestretch{|\meta{factor}|}| the width and height/depth,
%    respectively, of the boxes can be multiplied individually by a 
%    \meta{factor} to stretch ($>1$) or shrink ($<1$) the dimensions.
%    
%    \label{Lnumberingwidth}
%    The reserved space for the sequence numbering is set by the
%    command |\numberingwidth{|\meta{n digits}|}|. Here, the default setting
%    is four-digit numbering, i.\,e.\ $-999$ through 9999. If this range
%    is to be changed assign the desired number as parameter
%    \meta{n digits}, e.\,g.\ |\numberingwidth{111111}| reserves
%    space for 6 digit numbering.
%    
%    The vertical space between the sequence blocks can be controlled
%    by the commands |\smallblockskip|, |\medblockskip| (default 
%    setting), 
%    \label{Lsmallblockskip}\label{Lmedblockskip}
%    \label{Lbigblockskip}\label{Lnoblockskip}
%    \label{Lvblockspace}
%    |\bigblockskip| or |\noblockskip|. Further, the command 
%    |\vblockspace{|\meta{length}|}| allows one to set a defined space
%    length using any \TeX{} unit, e.\,g.\ |\vblockspace{0.4in}|.
%    
%    Two more commands set the space between the sequence blocks to be
%    \label{Lflexblockspace}\label{Lfixblockspace}
%    flexible (|\flexblockspace|) (default) or fixed (|\fixblockspace|).
%    Flexible means, that only the vertical white space between the
%    blocks is kept to the settings by
%    e.\,g. |\medblockskip|. This results in flexible space between 
%    the actual blocks depending on the presence of feature lines. When 
%    switching to fixed space the distance of the blocks is kept constant
%    by using more white space between blocks without feature lines.
%    Thus, a difference between flexible and fixed space will only be 
%    noticeable when features are used.
%    
%    \label{Lalignment}
%    The position of the output can be aligned left, right
%    or centered on the page by |\alignment{|\meta{position}|}| 
%    with the \meta{position} parameter |left|, |center| or 
%    |right|.
%    
%    
%    
%    \subsubsection{Fingerprinting}
%    
%    \label{fingerprint}
%    
%    \label{Lfingerprint}
%    An easy way to gain an overview on complete alignments is 
%    provided by displaying a so called alignment `fingerprint'.
%    In this style the whole sequence can be shown in one line. Due to
%    the lacking space the residue names are hidden and the shaded
%    boxes are reduced to thin vertical colored lines. The command
%    |\fingerprint{|\meta{res. per line}|}| takes one argument stating
%    the desired number of residues per line, e.\,g. |\fingerprint{1000}|.
%    All \TeXshade{} commands are compatible with |\fingerprint|, 
%    i.\,e. all shading modes are applicable for displaying overviews
%    on similarity or every functional aspect. Also, all kinds of
%    labeling---as described in the following---work with this
%    command.
%    
%    
%    \subsection{Individual shading and labeling of sequence stretches}
%    
%    Computer calculated conservation shading is informative---but
%    even more information can be visualized by additional labeling
%    of positions and regions of interest with different colors,
%    text styles or graphical marks and descriptive text. All this 
%    is provided by easy to handle \TeXshade{} commands.
%    
%    
%    \subsubsection{Shading of regions and blocks}
%    \label{shaderegion}
%    
%    \label{Lshaderegion}
%    Besides the shading calculated by \TeXshade{} any region can be
%    additionally shaded with a color specified by the user. This is very
%    useful to highlight secondary protein modification
%    sites such as phosphorylation or glycosylation sites, or longer
%    motifs for example protein/protein interaction sites or protein domains.
%    This is done with the following command:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\shaderegion{|\meta{seqref}|}{|\meta{selection}|}{|\meta{res.col.}|}{|\meta{shad.col.}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    Here, \meta{seqref} refers to the sequence by its name or number
%    within the alignment. The 
%    foreground and background colors can be set with the last two 
%    parameters. 
%    \meta{selection} can have three different formats
%    depending on whether (a) the user wants to select the positions manually,
%    (b) the selection should be based on a sequence motif to be found by \TeXshade{}, 
%    or (c) \TeXshade{} is supposed to select the residues based on 3D
%    coordinates provided by a PDB file.
%    \medskip
%    
%    (a) To select the residues manually, the user provides a position list of
%    the following format:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|{|\meta{start1}..\meta{stop1}|,|\meta{start2}..\meta{stop2}|,|\ldots|,|\meta{start n}..\meta{stop n}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    In order to shade residue number 13 and the region
%    20--30 of sequence number 1 in red letters on a green background 
%    type the following command:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\shaderegion{1}{13..13,20..30}{Red}{Green}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    If the consensus is to be shaded use |consensus| as 
%    \meta{seqref}.
%    \medskip
%    
%    (b) A sequence motif can be given, which will be found and labeled. A simple 
%    example selecting all sequence motifs `NNAD' in sequence `1' would be:
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad|\shaderegion{1}{NNAD}{Red}{Green}|
%    \medskip
%
%    The definition can further include `X' for any residue and groups of residues in brackets
%    at uncertain positions. The example below will find all motifs in sequence `1'
%    that start with an asparagine, followed by any two residues, an acidic, a
%    basic residue, again any two residues and finally a glutamine.
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\shaderegion{1}{NXX[DE][KR]XXQ}{Red}{Green}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    (c) In order to select positions based on the 3D structure a PDB
%    structure file is required. \TeXshade{} can select residues within
%    a given distance in \AA{} around a point, along a line, or above and
%    below a plane, which are defined by one to three residues. The points 
%    can be further specified to be the $\alpha$-carbon atom, i.\,e.\ the
%    protein backbone, or the most distant atom of the sidechain. Accordingly,
%    \meta{selection} has one of the formats:
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad|{point[|\meta{dist}|]:|\meta{file}|,|\meta{num}|[CA/side]}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|{line[|\meta{dist}|]:|\meta{file}|,|\meta{num1}|[CA/side],|\meta{num2}|[CA/side]}|
%    \medskip
%
%    \vbox{%    
%    \quad|{plane[|\meta{dist}|]:|\meta{file}|,|\meta{num1}|[CA/side],|\meta{num2}|[CA/side],|
%    \medskip
%
%    \hfill\meta{num3}|[CA/side]}|
%    }
%    \medskip
%    
%
%    Example: in order to select and shade as above all residues that are within an 8\ \AA{} 
%    sphere around the $\alpha$-carbon of residue 81 and the data are
%    provided in the PDB file |1J4N.pdb|, type:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\shaderegion{1}{point[8]:1J4N.pdb,81[CA]}{Red}{Green}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    Example: two points denote a line, hence, give two residues to select 
%    everything within 1\ \AA{} along the line between the $\alpha$-carbon of
%    residue 81 and the sidechain of residue 168 with:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\shaderegion{1}{line[1]:1J4N.pdb,81[CA],168[side]}|
%    \medskip
%
%    \hfill|{Red}{Green}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    Definition of a plane follows the same format but requires three points. 
%    If the optional parameters |[\meta{dist}]| and |[CA/side]| are not given,
%    \TeXshade{} assumes |[1]| and |[side]|, respectively.
%
%    In case one needs the position numbers of the selected residues for usage
%    in other applications, those can be either printed in the \TeX{} document with
%    |\printPDBlist{|\meta{selection}|}| or shown during the \TeX{} run with
%    |\messagePDBlist{|\meta{selection}|}|. The commands can be used outside of the 
%    \TeXshade{} environment. \label{LprintPDBlist}\label{LmessagePDBlist}
%    
%    Both selection formats, i.\,e. a manually given list and the 3D selection,
%    can be used with |\shadeblock| (see below), 
%    |\tintregion|, |\tintblock|, |\emphregion|, |\emphblock|, |\lowerregion|, |\lowerblock|,
%    |\frameblock| (all in \ref{Lframeblock}), and |\feature| (\ref{Lfeature}).
%
%
%    \label{Lshadeblock}
%    In analogy to |\shaderegion| which is restricted to a single
%    sequence, |\shadeblock| shades the corresponding region in all 
%    other sequences as well
%    except the consensus. If also the consensus is to be shaded 
%    define the region using |consensus| as \meta{seqref}.
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\shadeblock{|\meta{seqref}|}{|\meta{selection}|}{|\meta{res.col.}|}{|\meta{shad.col.}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    
%    Another option is to change the whole set of shading colors for certain
%    sequence blocks, e.\,g.\ from |blues| to |reds| or self-defined color sets (see \ref{Lshadingmode}).
%    Therefore, the following command was implemented: 
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad |\changeshadingcolors{|\meta{seqref}|}{|\meta{selection}|}{|\meta{name}|}|
%    \medskip \label{Lchangeshadingcolors}
%
%    Examples:
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad |\changeshadingcolors{1}{10..50}{reds}|
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad |\changeshadingcolors{AQP1}{[AS]NKD}{my_set}|
%    \medskip
%
%    etc.
%    
%    \subsubsection{Emphasizing, tinting, lowercasing, and framing}
%    
%    \label{Lemphregion}\label{Lemphblock}
%    If it is preferred to keep the calculated shading colors 
%    but distinct regions or blocks are yet to be emphasized one
%    can use the following commands to change the font style of 
%    such regions:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\emphregion{|\meta{seqref}|}{|\meta{selection}|}|
%    \medskip   
%    
%    and
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\emphblock{|\meta{seqref}|}{|\meta{selection}|}|
%    \medskip   
%    
%    For the format possibilities of the \meta{selection} parameter please see \ref{Lshaderegion}.
%
%    \label{Lemphdefault}
%    Which style \TeXshade{} uses for emphasizing regions is defined by 
%    |\emphdefault{|\meta{style}|}|. Default setting is the
%    \emph{italics} font shape (set by |\emphdefault{it}|). In order to change
%    this setting choose one of the styles |bf, md, up, it, sl, rm, sf, tt|.
%    
%    Example: |\emphdefault{bf}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    \label{Ltintregion}\label{Ltintblock}
%    Further, it is possible to tint the region or block in question
%    or to switch the characters to lowercase
%    by using the commands (for example see hydropathy-figure on page 
%    \pageref{hydro}):
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\tintregion{|\meta{seqref}|}{|\meta{selection}|}|
%    \medskip   
%    
%    and
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\tintblock{|\meta{seqref}|}{|\meta{selection}|}|
%    \medskip   
%    
%    \label{Ltintdefault}
%    The level of tinting in the region in question can be set by 
%    |\tintdefault{|\meta{level}|}| with |weak|, |normal|, and
%    |strong| as possible \meta{level}s.
%    \medskip
%    
%    \label{Llowerregion}\label{Llowerblock}
%    \quad|\lowerregion{|\meta{seqref}|}{|\meta{selection}|}|
%    \medskip   
%    
%    and
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\lowerblock{|\meta{seqref}|}{|\meta{selection}|}|
%    \medskip   
%    
%    
%    Another option is to draw a bounding box around the sequence block
%    in question (for an example see diversity mode-figure on page 
%    \pageref{frame}) with the 
%    command:\footnote{Thanks to Alan Robinson for inspiration.}
%    \medskip\label{Lframeblock}
%
%    \quad|\frameblock{|\meta{seqref}|}{|\meta{selection}|}{|\meta{color}|[|\meta{length}|]}|
%    \medskip
%
%    With the optional parameter the default line thickness of the frame can
%    be changed, example: |\frameblock{1}{10..20,50..70}{Red[2pt]}|
%
%
%
%
%    \subsubsection{Graphical labeling of sequence features}
%    
%    \label{feature}
%    
%    \label{Lfeature}
%    The |\feature| command is designed to fulfill most needs for the
%    graphical labeling of sequence stretches and the setting of descriptive 
%    text. It needs five parameters:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\feature{|\meta{position}|}{|\meta{seqref}|}{|\meta{selection}|}{|\meta{labelstyle}|}{|\meta{text}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    In the following paragraphs all possible parameter settings of 
%    this rather complex but mighty command are discussed in detail.
%    The parameter \meta{position} tells \TeXshade{} where to display
%    the feature label, i.\,e. on the top of the alignment (|top|),
%    or at the bottom (|bottom|). Further, there can be three more feature lines
%    ontop of the top feature line (|ttop|, |tttop|, and |ttttop|) or below the bottom
%    feature line (|bbottom|, |bbbottom|, |bbbbottom|). Thus, up to eight features
%    overlapping in eight different lines may be displayed. 
%    Depending on the content of the feature lines the gaps between 
%    them might be not satisfactory. 
%    \label{Ltopspace}\label{Lttopspace}
%    \label{Ltttopspace}\label{Lttttopspace}
%    \label{Lbottomspace}\label{Lbbottomspace}
%    \label{Lbbbottomspace}\label{Lbbbbottomspace}
%    Therefore, eight separate commands can be employed to change the 
%    space below |ttttop|, |tttop|, |ttop|, or |top| 
%    (|\topspace{|\meta{length}|}| etc.), and above 
%    |bottom|, |bbottom|, |bbbottom|, or |bbbbottom| 
%    (|\bottomspace{|\meta{length}|}| etc.). Use positive
%    values to further separate the lines, e.\,g. 
%    |\ttopspace{3mm}| or negative values to reduce the space, e.\,g.
%    |\bottomspace{-0.1in}|.
%    
%    The argument \meta{seqref} and the third 
%    parameter containing the \meta{selection} of the specified residues
%    are identical to the ones described before in several commands, e.\,g.
%    |\shaderegion| (\ref{shaderegion}). 
%    
%    New is the fourth parameter for the definition of the label style.
%    There are many possibilities like braces, helices, boxes, arrows, bars, any
%    fill character, bar graphs, color scales or even translations of the 
%    specified regions. 
%    \medskip
%
%    \textbf{Braces:}\\
%    In order to display an over- or underbrace as
%    a label use the parameter |{brace}|. Depending on the 
%    \meta{position} (|ttttop|, |tttop|, |ttop|, |top|, |bottom|,
%    |bbottom|, |bbbottom|, or |bbbbottom|) the respective brace is
%    displayed. The standard color of braces is 
%    black. It can be changed by an optional parameter directly after 
%    the definition of the symbol, e.\,g. |{brace[Red]}|.
%    \medskip
%
%    \textbf{Protein $\alpha$-Helices:}\\
%    The parameter |{helix}| will plot a symbolized $\alpha$-helix
%    as a label. The standard color of the helix spiral is 
%    black. It can be changed by an optional parameter directly after 
%    the definition of the symbol, e.\,g. |{helix[Red]}|.
%    \medskip
%
%    \textbf{Filling a stretch with a symbol:}\\
%    A region can be filled with any character for
%    labeling purposes using the parameter |{fill:|\meta{symbol}|}|.
%    The \meta{symbol} is freely selectable; the usage is like
%    in |\gapchar| (\ref{gapchar}). Do not use spaces before or after 
%    the expression \meta{symbol}; this will shift the symbols to the
%    respective direction. The standard color of the fill symbol is 
%    black. It can be changed by an optional parameter directly after 
%    the definition of the symbol, e.\,g. |{fill:$\bullet$[Red]}|.
%    
%    The |\feature| command does not like special characters in
%    text mode, e.\,g. |\dag|. One has to use the math version of
%    those symbols between |$|-signs. The following quite common
%    text symbols have also a math equivalent\footnote{Thanks to 
%    Darrell Conklin for reporting this problem}:
%    
%    \begin{center}
%    \begin{tabular}{cll}
%    \emph{symbol} & \emph{command} & \emph{description} \\ \hline
%    $\dagger$ & |$\dagger$| & dagger\\
%    $\ddagger$ & |$\ddagger$| & double dagger\\
%    $\mathparagraph$ & |$\mathparagraph$| & paragraph mark\\
%    $\mathsection$ & |$\mathsection$| & section mark\\
%    $\mathdollar$ & |$\mathdollar$| & dollar\\
%    $\lbrace$ & |$\lbrace$| & left brace\\
%    $\rbrace$ & |$\rbrace$| & right brace\\
%    \end{tabular}
%    \end{center}
%    \medskip
%
%    \textbf{Labeling restriction or protease cutting sites:}\\
%    If a label is needed that points between two residues, e.\,g.
%    for showing restriction sites, simply use the feature style
%    |{restriction[|\meta{color}|]}|. This will show a filled 
%    triangle with the tip right between the residues to be labeled,
%    e.\,g. |\feature{top}{1}{25..26}{restriction[Blue]}{EcoR I}|.
%
%    \medskip
%    
%    \textbf{Boxes:}\\
%    Boxed text is printed using the parameter |{box:|\meta{text}|}|.
%    By default black letters in a white framed box are displayed. In 
%    order to change these colors optional parameters can be included
%    in the argument: 
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad|{box[|\meta{framecolor,boxcolor}|][|\meta{length}|]:|\meta{text}|[|\meta{textcolor}|]}|.
%    \medskip
%
%    If the box frame and fill colors are the same it is sufficient to
%    use only this one color as an argument in the command. The optional
%    parameter \meta{length} defines the thickness of the box frame. If
%    this parameter is not set in the command the value from the 
%    |\featurerule{|\meta{length}|}| command (see below) is used.
%    \medskip
%    
%    Examples: 
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad|{box[Blue]:$\alpha$-helix[Yellow]}|
%    \smallskip
%
%    \quad|{box[Blue,Red]:$\alpha$-helix[Yellow]}|
%    \smallskip
%
%    \quad|{box[Blue,Red][2pt]:$\alpha$-helix[Yellow]}|
%    \medskip
%
%    \medskip
%    
%    \textbf{Horizontal bars and arrows:}\\
%    For displaying bars and arrows a simple selection scheme 
%    consisting of three consecutive characters is
%    used as the \meta{labelstyle} parameter. Each bar or arrow is
%    defined by its left end, the middle part, and the right end.
%    The following table gives some examples for the construction
%    of arrows and bars.
%    
%    \begin{center}
%    \begin{tabular}{cl}
%    middle & \\
%    \hbox to 1.6cm{\hss left end} \raisebox{1mm}{$\downarrow$} \hbox to 1.6cm{right end} & \\ \hline
%    |---|& plain bar \\
%    |===|& double bar \\
%    |-->|& right arrow \\
%    |'->|& right arrow with up hook \\
%    |<-|$\vert$ & left \emph{maps to} arrow \\
%    |<-o| & left arrow with ball at right end\\
%    |<=>|& double arrow, two heads \\
%    |,-,|& plain bar with down hooks\\
%    $\vert$|=|$\vert$ & double bar with vertical ends\\
%    \end{tabular}
%    \end{center}
%    
%    All combinations of the left-end-characters 
%    (|-=<',|$\vert$o), the middle-characters (|-=|),
%    and the right-end-characters (|-=>',|$\vert$o) are
%    allowed and produce the desired arrow or bar.
%    The color is changed as described above.
%    \label{Lfeaturerule} The thickness can be generally 
%    set by the separate command |\featurerule{|\meta{length}|}|
%    with any \TeX{} measure as \meta{length}, e.\,g.\ |\featurerule{3pt}|. 
%    This value is then used for all arrows, bars, and boxes (see above)
%    throughout the alignment. If an individual thickness for a 
%    particular arrow should be set one can add an optional
%    parameter to the \meta{labelstyle} parameter, e.g.
%    |{o->[Red][1mm]}|. Similar to the boxes described above, a text can be put on
%    the arrow or bar, e.\,g.\ |{<->[Red][1mm]:$\beta$-sheet[Blue]}|.
%
%
%    In \TeXshade{} versions before v1.9, the original \LaTeX{}-arrows 
%    were used. These have now been replaced by more modern looking
%    arrows with scalable line thickness. If the classical look is
%    requested, use |v| instead of |<| or |>| in the arrow definition,
%    e.\,g.\ |{--v}|, to get them back. The new arrow style makes use of
%    of the AMS math symbol font (amssymb.sty). Thus, in order to 
%    display the arrow heads correctly make sure that this style is    
%    present on your system (usually it is in a common \LaTeX{} installation).
%    \medskip
%
%    \textbf{Sequence translations:}\\
%    With the option |{translate}|, sequence stretches can be 
%    translated from nucleotide to peptide sequences as well as 
%    backtranslations from peptide to nucleotide sequences are
%    possible. Default setting for the translations is the standard
%    genetic code. Of course, the codons can be re-defined by the
%    user. The command \label{Lcodon}
%    |\codon{|\meta{amino acid}|}{|\meta{triplet1, \ldots, triplet n}|}|
%    has been implemented for this issue. The usage is simple. Replace
%    \meta{amino acid} by the single letter code of the amino acid
%    to be defined and add a list of triplets for this residue.    
%    Example definition for the amino acid \emph{alanine}:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad |\codon{A}{GCA,GCG,GCC,GCT,GCU,GCN}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    Note the last triplet in the list. It contains an ambiguity code
%    |N| which stands for \emph{any} nucleotide. This triplet has been 
%    added at the last position because the last triplet is used
%    for the generation of the backtranslated nucleotide sequence from
%    a peptide. Two files are included in the \TeXshade{}
%    distribution as examples (|standard.cod, ciliate.cod|). If you 
%    want to define a new genetic code store your commands in a file 
%    like the examples. Such files with the suffix |.cod| can be 
%    loaded in the \TeXshade{} environment by \label{Lgeneticcode}
%    |\geneticcode{|\meta{filename}|}|, e.\,g. |\geneticcode{ciliate}|.
%    Do not designate the suffix |.cod| in \meta{filename}. Please 
%    note, when inspecting the example files, that only the exchanges
%    compared to the standard code need to be defined in a new genetic code file. 
%    
%    When DNA sequences are translated to protein the resulting amino
%    acids are aligned to the second nucleotide of each triplet. 
%    It is more difficult to produce a satisfactory display of
%    backtranslated nucleotide sequences due to the lack of space. 
%    You need thrice as much space than the original peptide sequence,
%    because single letter amino acid code is translated to a triplet
%    code. Therefore, the user can choose from five display styles
%    for backtranslations depending on personal preferences:
%    \medskip\label{Lbacktranslabel}
%    
%    \quad |\backtranslabel[|\meta{size}|]{|\meta{style}|}|, with
%    \medskip
%    
%    \begin{tabbing}
%    \qquad\qquad|{|\meta{style}|}|\ \= = |{horizontal}|\\
%       \> = |{alternating}|\\
%       \> = |{zigzag}|\\
%       \> = |{oblique}|\\
%       \> = |{vertical}|
%    \end{tabbing}
%    
%    \meta{size} can be any \TeX{} size from |tiny| up to |Huge|, but 
%    |tiny| is recommended (and default setting). Translations
%    can be colored as all other labels, see above.
%    \medskip
%
%    \textbf{Bar graphs and color scales:}\label{Lgraphs}\\
%    Sequence related numeral data, such as hydropathy or solvent
%    accessibility data etc., can be shown in a feature line as bar graphs
%    or color scales. The data are (a) pre-defined or calculated by 
%    \TeXshade{} due to amino acid properties or conservation, (b) are 
%    provided in a separate file or (c) may be entered by hand in the 
%    |\feature| command. 
%
%    (a) Currently, three different
%    properties can be plotted, i.e. |hydrophobicity|, |molweight|, and 
%    |charge|. Further, the level of sequence conservation at the given
%    protein sequence stretch can be shown (|conservation|). See 
%    \ref{resweight} for selecting an appropriate \emph{residue weight table}.
%
%    (b) The format of a data file is simple: every value must 
%    appear in a separate line. Numbers and the Java-typical `NaN' for
%    `Not a Number' are permitted. Comments are allowed, because \TeXshade{}
%    ignores all lines starting with a letter except `NaN' lines (avoid 
%    `|-|' as the first
%    character of a comment line as this is interpreted as a negative number).
%    Make sure that there are as many values as positions defined as the 
%    sequence stretch in the feature command.
%    \TeXshade{} will read this file and determine the minimal and maximal 
%    values. These data are then normalized for plotting.
%    Due to \TeX's limited calculation capabilities no values above 10\,737
%    are allowed and the difference between minimum and maximum must not
%    exceed this very number. Values below 0.001 may be susceptible to major
%    rounding errors. Thus, try to provide your data already normalized to
%    moderate scales, e.g. 0.0\,--\,1.0 or -100\,--\,100. 

%    (c) Data which is  
%    directly entered in the |\feature| command must be normalized to integer
%    values with a maximal difference of 100 between the highest and lowest
%    value, e.g. -50\,--\,50 or 0\,--\,100.
%
%    For (b) and (c), the range to be plotted can be set by hand as an optional parameter
%    in the |\feature| command. This can be necessary when the data file
%    contains values between e.g. $-0.44$ and $0.87$. Without help \TeXshade{} 
%    will assume $-0.44$ as minimum and $0.87$ as maximum. But if the actual 
%    range to be plotted should be $-1.0$\,--\,$1.0$ this needs to be set
%    manually, see examples below. Be aware of the fact, that if you 
%    define a scale by hand, which is more narrow than the values of the
%    input, this will stretch the bars accordingly. It is NOT recommended
%    to use this method for stretching bars vertically. Instead another
%    command has been introduced. 
%    \label{Lbargraphstretch}\label{Lcolorscalestretch}
%    The plotted bars can be stretched by a factor if the appearance is
%    not as desired: |\bargraphstretch{|\meta{factor}|}|. Here, the factor 
%    is multiplied with the bar length, e.g |\bargraphstretch{2}| will double
%    the bar height, |\bargraphstretch{0.5}| will make them half as high.
%    Similarly, color scales can be stretched vertically with 
%    |\colorscalestretch{|\meta{factor}|}|.
%
%    The default color of bar graphs is gray and can be changed by an 
%    optional parameter at the end of the |label| definition. Further, an optional 
%    background color can be chosen for the bars. Doing so will visualize
%    the maximal bar extension.
%
%    Default for
%    color scales is a 5\% gray scale from very light gray to black (|Gray|).
%    More colorful scales have been implemented, i.e. |BlueRed|, |RedBlue|, |GreenRed|,
%    |RedGreen|, |ColdHot| and |HotCold|, the latter two being particularly 
%    useful for ranges from negative to positive values. Further, a scale called |T-Coffee|
%    is available if |T-Coffee| shading information has been imported as the 
%    |\shadingmode| \ref{Lshadingmode}.
%
%
%
%    The general format of this feature label definition for bar graphs is:
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad |{bar[|\meta{min}|,|\meta{max}|]:|\meta{properties/file/data}|[|\meta{color(,bgcolor)}|]}|
%    \medskip
%
%    and for color scales:
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad|{color[|\meta{min}|,|\meta{max}|]:|\meta{properties/file/data}|[|\meta{scale}|]}|
%    \medskip
%
%    Some examples:
%    \medskip
%
%    \qquad |{bar:conservation}|
%    \medskip

%    \medskip
%
%    \textbf{No graphical label, only text:}\\
%    If no graphical label is
%    wanted the fourth parameter of |\feature| can be empty
%    braces.
%    \medskip
%    
%    Finally, the fifth parameter of the |\feature| command contains 
%    the descriptive text
%    for the labeled region. Type whatever you want incl. symbols and
%    math chars. The text field can also contain sequence translations.
%    In this case just set \meta{text} = |{translate}|. There is a 
%    command for setting the size and style of backtranslated sequences
%    in the feature \meta{text} which corresponds to the one
%    described above: \label{Lbacktranstext}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad |\backtranstext[|\meta{size}|]{|\meta{style}|}|
%    \medskip    
%    
%    Again, the color can be set by an
%    optional parameter appended to the text. For how to change the 
%    font size of text or symbols in the feature style line 
%    (|featurestyles|) or the in descriptive text line (|features|)
%    see section \ref{Lsetsize}, page \pageref{Lsetsize}.
%    
%    Another set of commands can be used to set a name for a feature
%    line, which is printed together with the sequence names at the
%    left or right side of the alignment, i.\,e.\ 
%    \medskip
%
%                    \label{Lshowfeaturename} \label{Lshowfeaturestylename}
%                    \label{Lhidefeaturename} \label{Lhidefeaturestylename}
%                    \label{Lhidefeaturenames} \label{Lhidefeaturestylenames}
%    \quad |\showfeaturename{|\meta{ttttop...bbbbottom}|}{|\meta{name}|}|,
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad |\showfeaturestylename{|\meta{ttttop...bbbbottom}|}{|\meta{name}|}|
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad |\hidefeaturename{|\meta{ttttop...bbbbottom}|}|
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad |\hidefeaturestylename{|\meta{ttttop...bbbbottom}|}|
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad |\hidefeaturenames|, and |\hidefeaturestylenames|.
%    \medskip
%
%    Using |\showfeaturename| will print the name in the same line as
%    the descriptive text of the feature whereas | \showfeaturestylename|
%    will put the name in the same line as the feature symbols.
%
%    The color of such names can be generally changed with \label{Lfeaturenamescolor}
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad |\featurenamescolor{|\meta{color}|}| and \label{Lfeaturestylenamescolor}
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad |\featurestylenamescolor{|\meta{color}|}| 
%    \medskip
%
%    or individually with \label{Lfeaturenamecolor}
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad |\featurenamecolor{|\meta{ttttop...bbbbottom}|}{|\meta{color}|}| and \label{Lfeaturestylenamecolor}
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad |\featurestylenamecolor{|\meta{ttttop...bbbbottom}|}{|\meta{color}|}| 
%    \medskip
%
%    See section \ref{colors} for how to select colors in \TeX{}shade.
%
%    Font styles can be set as usual (see section \ref{Lsetfamily}), e.\,g.\ 
%    \medskip
%    
%    |\setsize{featurenames}{large}| or |\featurestylenamesrm| etc. 
%    \medskip

%    \subsubsection{Including secondary structure information}
%    
%    \label{structure}
%    
%    \label{LincludeDSSP}
%    \label{LincludeSTRIDE}
%    \label{LincludePHDsec}
%    \label{LincludePHDtopo}
%    \label{LincludeHMMTOP}
%    The DSSP [9], STRIDE [10], PHD [11] and HMMTOP [12] algorithms produce 
%    secondary protein structure predictions. PHD files contain both,
%    secondary structure information and topology data. This information can be
%    displayed in an alignment by one of the commands:
%    \bigskip
%    
%    \begin{tabular}{ll}
%    |\includeDSSP| & sec. structure calculated by DSSP\\
%    
%    |\includeSTRIDE| & sec. structure calculated by STRIDE \\
%    
%    |\includePHDsec| & sec. structure calculated by PHD \\
%    
%    |\includePHDtopo| & topology data calculated by PHD \\
%    
%    |\includeHMMTOP| & topology data calculated by HMMTOP \\
%    \end{tabular}
%    \bigskip
%    
%    The syntax is |\includeDSSP{|\meta{seqref}|}{|\meta{filename}|}|,
%    with |seqref| indicating the number or name of the sequence for which 
%    the secondary structure data is calculated and |filename| designating the 
%    corresponding structure file to be included.
%    
%    Several types of secondary structures are predicted by these 
%    programs; in order to designate them in \TeXshade{} use the names
%    from the right column:
%    
%    \begin{center}
%    \begin{tabular}{ll}
%    secondary structure & designation\\[3mm]
%    \emph{DSSP and STRIDE} & \\[2mm]
%    4-helix ($\alpha$-helix) & |alpha| \\
%    isolated $\beta$-bridge  & |bridge| \\
%    extended strand ($\beta$-strand) & |beta| \\
%    3-helix (3$_{10}$-helix) & |3-10| \\
%    5-helix ($\pi$-helix)    & |pi| \\
%    H-bonded turn            & |turn| \\[3mm]
%    \emph{PHDsec} & \\[2mm]
%    helix                    & |alpha| \\
%    sheet                    & |beta| \\[3mm]
%    \emph{PHDtopo and HMMTOP} & \\[2mm]
%    internal region          & |internal| \\
%    external region          & |external| \\
%    transmembrane domain     & |TM| \\
%    \end{tabular}
%    \end{center}
%    
%    \label{LshowonDSSP}
%    \label{LshowonSTRIDE}
%    \label{LshowonPHDsec}
%    \label{LshowonPHDtopo}
%    \label{LshowonHMMTOP}
%    \label{LhideonDSSP}
%    \label{LhideonSTRIDE}
%    \label{LhideonPHDsec}
%    \label{LhideonPHDtopo}
%    \label{LhideonHMMTOP}
%    By default all three types of helices and the strands are 
%    displayed whereas turns and bridges are skipped. If it is 
%    desired to shown them as well, call for example |\shownonDSSP{bridge,turn}|.
%    In analogy to this example all structure features can be activated
%    in DSSP, STRIDE, PHDsec, PHDtopo and HMMTOP. In order to hide
%    certain structure types use for example |\hideonDSSP{3-10,pi}|.
%    
%    The DSSP format has two columns of sequence numberings. The first 
%    column is consecutive, whereas the second column contains the 
%    actual sequence numbering. This can be different from the first
%    column when sequence parts are missing in the DSSP file. One can
%    choose which column will be read by \TeXshade{} by 
%    \label{LfirstcolumnDSSP} \label{LsecondcolumnDSSP}
%    `|\firstcolumnDSSP|' and |\secondcolumnDSSP|'. The second column 
%    is still default.
%    
%    The HMMTOP algorithm can present its results as plain text or 
%    as HTML---plain text needs to be selected here. Further, the 
%    output can be formatted in a single line or in an extended form 
%    (see the HMMTOP documentation). Both can be read and interpreted 
%    by \TeXshade{}. Importantly, HMMTOP files can contain topology
%    predictions of multiple sequences. \TeXshade{} tries to find
%    the correct data based on the respective sequence name. If the
%    sequence name is not found in the file, the first topology data
%    is used. Using an optional parameter (number of the prediction
%    in the file or name) one can define which data from the file is
%    to be used:
%    \medskip
%    
%    |\includeHMMTOP{|\meta{seqref in texshade}|[|\meta{seqref in file}|]}{|\meta{filename}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    PHD predictions: when starting the PHD software do not
%    restrict the prediction to secondary structure or topology alone.
%    This leads to changes in the PHD output file which are not
%    correctly interpretable by \TeXshade{} due to ambiguities. There
%    is no way around it---thus, run the full prediction.
%
%    Now, some information on how \TeXshade{} extracts and displays
%    secondary structure features. In short, it is a two step process.
%    First, \TeXshade{} analyzes the secondary structure file and 
%    extracts all necessary data. This data is converted into a 
%    format which is readable and processable by \TeXshade{} using the 
%    |feature| command (see \ref{feature}). This command allows one to 
%    label sequence stretches graphically. For a detailed explanation
%    see the indicated reference. A list of feature commands is saved
%    in a file with the ending `|.sec|' for DSSP, STRIDE and PHDsec
%    or `|.top|' for PHDtopo. Then, in a second step, this file is loaded 
%    again and executed. When \TeXshade{} encouters this file a
%    second time, i.\,e. in a second \TeX{} run, it uses the already
%    existing file for the output. The great advantage of this method 
%    is its flexibility. Due to the simple reason that the feature 
%    file can be edited in the meantime. Thus, the user has the 
%    ability to change the computer generated file according to his
%    personal needs. On the other hand, one can force \TeXshade{} to
%    write a new file every time by the optional argument |[make new]| in the 
%    include command, e.\,g. |\includePHDsec[make new]{1}{AQP.phd}|.
%    
%    \label{Lappearance}
%    Finally, the appearance of the feature labels can be assigned by 
%    the command 
%    
%    |\appearance{|\meta{filetype}|}{|\meta{type}|}{|\meta{position}|}{|\meta{labelstyle}|}{|\meta{text}|}|.
%    
%    Here, \meta{filetype} stands for one of the following secondary structure 
%    file types: |DSSP|, |STRIDE|, |PHDsec|, |PHDtopo| or |HMMTOP| and 
%    \meta{type} designates the secondary structure type as shown in 
%    the right column of the table above. The other
%    arguments \meta{position}, \meta{labelstyle} and \meta{text} 
%    are almost as described in \ref{feature}. 
%    \label{Lnumcount}
%    \label{Lalphacount}
%    \label{LAlphacount}
%    \label{Lromancount}
%    \label{LRomancount}
%    One further possibility
%    is to include internal counters for each secondary structure type.
%    Just add one of the following commands 
%    to the text in the feature description. 
%    
%    \begin{center}
%    \begin{tabular}{ll}
%    \emph{counter} & \emph{display} \\[2mm]
%    |\numcount|     & 1, 2, 3 \ldots \\
%    |\alphacount|   & a, b, c \ldots \\
%    |\Alphacount|   & A, B, C \ldots \\
%    |\romancount|   & i, ii, iii \ldots \\
%    |\Romancount|   & I, II, III \ldots \\
%    \end{tabular}
%    \end{center}
%    
%    Examples: 
%    
%    \quad|\appearance{DSSP}{alpha}{ttop}|
%    
%    \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad|{-->}{$\alpha$-helix~\Alphacount}|
%    
%    \quad|\appearance{PHDtopo}{TM}{bottom}|
%    
%    \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad|{box[Blue]:TM\numcount[Yellow]}{}|
%    
%    
%    \subsection{Displaying and building legends}
%    
%    \label{Lshowlegend}\label{Lhidelegend}\label{Lmovelegend}
%    \label{Lgermanlanguage}\label{Lenglishlanguage}\label{Llegendcolor}
%    \label{Lspanishlanguage}
%    For each predefined shading mode \TeXshade{} can print an appropriate
%    legend to explain the used
%    shading colors. The commands |\showlegend| and |\hidelegend|
%    display or clear the legend at the end of the alignment. 
%    The legend is displayed by default beneath the first residue 
%    of the last alignment line. The location can be changed by 
%    |\movelegend{|\meta{x-offset}|}{|\meta{y-offset}|}|. Both 
%    parameters require a \TeX{} length, e.\,g. |\movelegend{5cm}{-2cm}|
%    moves the legend 5\,cm to the right and 2\,cm up.
%    
%    The language for the descriptions is english by default;
%    if the |\german.sty| package is active legend texts are in 
%    german. So far, german, spanish and english are implemented. With the 
%    commands |\germanlanguage|, |\spanishlanguage| and |\englishlanguage| 
%    switching between the languages 
%    is made possible. For the addition of other languages contact me.
%    Finally, the color of the describing legend texts can be set 
%    with the command |\legendcolor{|\meta{color}|}|.
%    
%    User defined legends are easily built with the following command
%    \label{Lshadebox}|\shadebox{|\meta{color}|}|. Use this command outside 
%    the \TeXshade{} environment, e.\,g. in the text or in the caption. As 
%    \meta{color} any color can be designated (see section \ref{colors}) or 
%    one of the following parameters:
%    
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item |nomatch| = the color used for nonmatching residues
%    
%    \item |similar| = the color used for similar residues
%    
%    \item |conserved| = the color used for conserved residues
%    
%    \item |allmatch| = the color used for highly conserved residues 
%                       (if |\allmatchspecial| is active)
%    
%    \end{itemize}
%    
%    The command simply prints a shaded box in the specified color 
%    then a describing text can be appended. Examples:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\shadebox{nomatch}---nonmatching residues| 
%    
%    \quad|\shadebox{similar}: similar residues| 
%    
%    \quad|\shadebox{conserved}~conserved residues| 
%    
%    \quad|\shadebox{Yellow}\quad PKA phosphorylation sites|
%    
%    
%    
%    \subsection{Adding captions to the alignment}
%    
%    Since \TeXshade{} v1.5 captions can be added to the alignment. 
%    So far, captions were difficult to use when the alignment was
%    bigger than one page and therefore did not fit into a 
%    figure environment. The \TeXshade{} captions behave exactly as 
%    normal figure captions. They
%    adopt their style, use the figure counter number and appear in
%    the list of figures as any other figure.
%    
%    The usage is slightly different from normal captions but 
%    intuitive: \label{Lshowcaption}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad |\showcaption[|\meta{position}|]{|\meta{text}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    The optional \meta{position} tells \TeXshade{} to put the caption on
%    |top| or at the |bottom| of the alignment. If nothing is stated here
%    the caption will appear at the bottom. The parameter
%    \meta{text} just holds the caption text as in the normal |\caption|.
%    The command can be used at any position within the |texshade|
%    environment. A simple example would be: 
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad |\showcaption{A beautiful \TeXshade{} alignment.}|
%    \medskip
%
%    \label{Lshortcaption}
%    In order to show a short version of the caption in the 
%    "List of Figures" the |\shortcaption{|\meta{short caption text}|}| 
%    command can be used.
%    
%    \subsection{Font handling}
%    
%    \subsubsection{Changing font styles}
%    
%    \label{Lsetfamily}\label{Lsetseries}
%    \label{Lsetshape}\label{Lsetsize}
%    The font styles for the numbering, the sequence names,
%    the sequence residues, the descriptive feature texts
%    and the legends can be changed by several commands.
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\setfamily{|\meta{text}|}{|\meta{family}|}|
%    
%    \quad|\setseries{|\meta{text}|}{|\meta{series}|}|
%    
%    \quad|\setshape{|\meta{text}|}{|\meta{shape}|}|
%

%    \subsubsection{Using PostScript fonts}
%    
%    As already mentioned \TeXshade{} makes intensive use of
%    \textsc{PostScript} for shading. Now, that 
%    \textsc{PostScript} output is active anyway, including \textsc{PostScript}
%    fonts is very easy. Just declare in the document header
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad |\usepackage{|\meta{PS-font}|}|.
%    \medskip
%    
%    
%    The typewriter font of \TeX{} is always a topic of discussions.
%    By including the package |\usepackage{courier}| \TeX's 
%    typewriter font is replaced by the widely accepted \textsc{Courier}.
%    Have a look into the directory |..texinputs:latex:psnfss|; there, 
%    some styles are located which exchange the common \TeX{} fonts by 
%    \textsc{PostScript} fonts, e.\,g.\ |avant.sty|, |bookman.sty|,
%    |chancery.sty|, |courier.sty|, |helvet.sty| or |utopia.sty|.
%    Depending on the style used the |\rmdefault|-, |\sfdefault|-,
%    and |\ttdefault| fonts are substituted partly or completely.
%    Thus, |courier.sty| for instance exchanges only the typewriter font, 
%    whereas |bookman.sty| sets \textsc{Bookman} as |\rmdefault|,
%    \textsc{Avantgarde} as |\sfdefault| and \textsc{Courier} as
%    |\ttdefault|.
%    
%    For further information see \textsc{Tomas Rokicki}'s 
%    |dvips| manual [13].
%    
%    
%    
%    
%    \subsection{Goodies}
%    
%    The following commands give information on sequence properties,
%    such as molecular weight, charge or similarity data. They can
%    be used outside the |texshade| environment directly in the 
%    document or in a caption text.
%
%    \subsubsection{Molweight and charge}
%    
%    \label{molcharge}
%    
%    \label{Lmolweight}\label{Lcharge}
%    During the process of sequence setting \TeXshade{}
%    sums up the molecular weight and charge of the
%    aligned proteins. This data can be accessed by the 
%    following commands.
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\molweight{|\meta{seqref}|}{|\meta{Da/kDa}|}|
%    
%    \quad|\charge{|\meta{seqref}|}{|\meta{i/o/N/C}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    The first parameter \meta{seqref} selects the sequence. The
%    second parameter in the |\molweight| command allows one to
%    switch the units between Dalton (|Da|) and kilo-Dalton 
%    (|kDa|). The |\charge| command needs the second parameter
%    for the correct consideration of the charged protein termini.
%    Thus, `|i|' refers to internal sequences, `|o|' to the 
%    overall charge, `|N|' to N-terminal sequence parts, and
%    `|C|' to the C-terminal end of a protein.
%    \medskip
%    
%    Example: \quad Charge: |\charge{1}{o}|; Weight: |\molweight{1}{Da}|
%    
%    \subsubsection{Similarity/identity data and tables}
%    
%    \label{simtable}
%    The degree of similarity and identity in percent for any two
%    sequences in the displayed alignment section can be read out 
%    with the commands
%    \label{Lpercentsimilarity} \label{Lpercentidentity} 
%    |\percentsimilarity{|\meta{seqref1}|}{|\meta{seqref2}|}| and
%    |\percentidentity{|\meta{seqref1}|}{|\meta{seqref2}|}|.
%    
%    Using the example alignment on page \pageref{simtableEx} and
%    typing outside the |texshade| environment in the document text the
%    following phrase:
%    \bigskip
% 
%    \quad\quad |AQP1 and AQP2 share a sequence similarity|
%
%    \quad\quad |of \percentsimilarity{AQP1.pro}{AQP2.pro}\%| 
%    \bigskip
% 
%    will result in the text:
%    \bigskip
%
%    \quad\quad AQP1 and AQP2 share a sequence similarity of 69.6\%
%    \bigskip
%    
%    Likewise, |\percentidentity{1}{2}| will give the value |48.4|; note that 
%    sequences can be referred to by their number or their assigned name. The
%    percent value is calculated by dividing the number of identical or similar
%    positions, respectively, by the total of non-gap positions shared by both 
%    sequences. Here, only the part of the alignment is taken into account that
%    is actually displayed. Two residues are considered similar when this is 
%    defined by the command |\pepsims| (see page \pageref{Lpepsims}).
%
%    A full similarity/identity table showing values for all sequences of the
%    alignment can be set using |\similaritytable|.\label{Lsimilaritytable} 
%    The labels and number format will be adjusted according to the language 
%    settings (\ref{Lgermanlanguage}).
%    \medskip
% 
%    Example (see section \ref{simtableEx}):
%    \medskip
%
%    \vbox{%
%    \quad |\begin{center}|
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad\quad|\similaritytable|
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad |\end{center}|
%    }
%    \bigskip
%
%    The command generates a valid \LaTeX{} |tabular|
%    environment, which can be embedded into a |table| environment, e.g.
%    \medskip
%    
%    \vbox{%
%    \quad |\begin{table}[htdp]|
%
%    \quad |\caption{Text ...}|
%
%    \quad |\begin{center}|
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad\quad|\similaritytable|
%    \medskip
%
%    \quad |\end{center}|
%
%    \quad |\end{table}|
%    }

%    \section{The PostScript color selection scheme}
%    
%    \label{colors}
%    
%    \textsc{PostScript} provides 64 standard colors. All these 
%    colors are predefined in the |color.sty|. Each color
%    has a pictorial name such as |Bittersweet| and a distinct 
%    composition, e.\,g.\ 0\% cyan + 75\% magenta + 100\% yellow + 
%    24\% black---the so-called CMYK scheme. \TeXshade{} enhances this
%    color scheme by gray scales in 5\% steps. 
%    The following colors and grays can be used in \TeXshade{} by 
%    simply declaring the name of the color in the respective 
%    command, e.\,g.\ |\consensuscolors|:
%    
%    
%    \begin{footnotesize}
%    \begin{tabbing}

%    Type the color names with the upper case letters exactly as described above.
%    For the definition of new colors use one of the |color.sty| commands:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\definecolor{|\meta{name}|}{cmyk}{|\meta{C,M,Y,K}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\definecolor{|\meta{name}|}{rgb}{|\meta{R,G,B}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    The \meta{name} can be chosen freely, the values for the color
%    composition must be in the range 0--1, i\,e.\ 0--100\% of the 
%    respective component (`C' -- cyan, `M' -- magenta, `Y' -- yellow,
%    `K' -- black; or `R' -- red, `G' -- green, `Blue' -- blue) separated by 
%    commas.

About the network method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The network procedure is described in detail in:
1) Rost, Burkhard; Sander, Chris:
  Prediction of protein structure at better than 70% accuracy.
  J. Mol. Biol., 1993, 232, 584-599.            

A brief description is given in:
  Rost, Burkhard; Sander, Chris:
  Improved prediction of protein secondary structure by use of se-
  quence profiles and neural networks.
  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1993, 90, 7558-7562.           

The PHD mail server is described in:
2) Rost, Burkhard; Sander, Chris; Schneider, Reinhard:
  PHD - an automatic mail server for protein secondary structure
  prediction.
  CABIOS, 1994, 10, 53-60.

The latest improvement steps (up to 72%) are explained in:
3) Rost, Burkhard; Sander, Chris:
  Combining evolutionary information and neural networks to predict
  protein secondary structure.
  Proteins, 1994,  19, 55-72.

To be quoted for publications of PHD output:
  Papers 1-3 for the prediction of secondary structure and the pre-
  diction server.



About the input to the network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The prediction is performed by a system of neural networks.
The input is a multiple sequence alignment. It is taken from an HSSP
file (produced by the program MaxHom:
  Sander, Chris & Schneider, Reinhard: Database of Homology-Derived
  Structures and the Structural Meaning of Sequence Alignment.
  Proteins, 1991, 9, 56-68.

For optimal results the alignment should contain sequences with varying
degrees of sequence similarity relative to the input protein.
The following is an ideal situation:

+-----------------+----------------------+
|   sequence:     |  sequence identity   |
+-----------------+----------------------+
| target sequence |  100 %               |
| aligned seq. 1  |   90 %               |
| aligned seq. 2  |   80 %               |
|      ...        |   ...                |
| aligned seq. 7  |   30 %               |
+-----------------+----------------------+



Estimated Accuracy of Prediction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A careful cross validation test on some 250 protein chains (in total
about 55,000 residues) with less than 25% pairwise sequence identity
gave the following results:

++================++-----------------------------------------+
|| Qtotal = 72.1% ||      ("overall three state accuracy")   |
++================++-----------------------------------------+

+----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| Qhelix (% of observed)=70% | Qhelix (% of predicted)=77% |
| Qstrand(% of observed)=62% | Qstrand(% of predicted)=64% |
| Qloop  (% of observed)=79% | Qloop  (% of predicted)=72% |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------+
..........................................................................

These percentages are defined by:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|                    number of correctly predicted residues
|Qtotal =            ---------------------------------------      (*100)
|                          number of all residues
|
|                    no of res correctly predicted to be in helix
|Qhelix (% of obs) = -------------------------------------------- (*100)
|                    no of all res observed to be in helix
|
|
|                    no of res correctly predicted to be in helix
|Qhelix (% of pred)= -------------------------------------------- (*100)
|                    no of all residues predicted to be in helix

..........................................................................

Averaging over single chains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most reasonable way to compute the overall accuracies is the above
quoted percentage of correctly predicted residues.  However, since the
user is mainly interested in the expected performance of the prediction
for a particular protein, the mean value when averaging over protein
chains might be of help as well.  Computing first the three state
accuracy for each protein chain, and then averaging over 250 chains
yields the following average:

+-------------------------------====--+
| Qtotal/averaged over chains = 72.2% |
+-------------------------------====--+
| standard deviation          =  9.3% |
+-------------------------------------+

..........................................................................

Further measures of performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Matthews correlation coefficient:

+---------------------------------------------+
| Chelix = 0.63, Cstrand = 0.53, Cloop = 0.52 |
+---------------------------------------------+
..........................................................................

Average length of predicted secondary structure segments:

.           +------------+----------+
.           |  predicted | observed |
+-----------+------------+----------+
| Lhelix  = |    10.3    |    9.3   |
| Lstrand = |     5.0    |    5.3   |
| Lloop   = |     7.2    |    5.9   |
+-----------+------------+----------+
..........................................................................

The accuracy matrix in detail:

+---------------------------------------+
|    number of residues with H, E, L    |
+---------+------+------+------+--------+
|         |net H |net E |net L |sum obs |
+---------+------+------+------+--------+
| obs H   |12447 | 1255 | 3990 |  17692 |
| obs E   |  949 | 7493 | 3750 |  12192 |
| obs L   | 2604 | 2875 |19962 |  25441 |
+---------+------+------+------+--------+
| sum Net |16000 |11623 |27702 |  55325 |
+---------+------+------+------+--------+

Note: This table is to be read in the following manner:
     12447 of all residues predicted to be in helix, were observed to
     be in helix, 949 however belong to observed strands, 2604 to
     observed loop regions.  The term "observed" refers to the DSSP
     assignment of secondary structure calculated from 3D coordinates
     of experimentally determined structures (Dictionary of Secondary
     Structure  of Proteins: Kabsch & Sander (1983) Biopolymers, 22,
     2577-2637).



Position-specific reliability index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The network predicts the three secondary structure types using real
numbers from the output units. The prediction is assigned by choosing
the maximal unit ("winner takes all").  However, the real numbers
contain additional information.
E.g. the difference between the maximal and the second largest output
unit can be used to derive a "reliability index".  This index is given
for each residue along with the prediction.  The index is scaled to
have values between 0 (lowest reliability), and 9 (highest).
The accuracies (Qtot) to be expected for residues with values above a
particular value of the index are given below as well as the fraction
of such residues (%res).:

+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| index|  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |
| %res |100.0| 99.2| 90.4| 80.9| 71.6| 62.5| 52.8| 42.3| 29.8| 14.1|
+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Qtot | 72.1| 72.3| 74.8| 77.7| 80.3| 82.9| 85.7| 88.5| 91.1| 94.2|
|      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

The above table gives the cumulative results, e.g. 62.5% of all
residues have a reliability of at least 5.  The overall three-state
accuracy for this subset of almost two thirds of all residues is 82.9%.
For this subset, e.g., 83.1% of the observed helices are correctly
predicted, and 86.9% of all residues predicted to be in helix are
correct.

About the network method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The network for prediction of secondary structure is described in
detail in:
  Rost, Burkhard; Sander, Chris:
  Prediction of protein structure at better than 70% accuracy.
  J. Mol. Biol., 1993, 232, 584-599.

The analysis of the prediction of solvent exposure is given in:
  Rost, Burkhard; Sander, Chris:
  Conservation and prediction of solvent accessibility in protein
  families.  Proteins, 1994, 20, 216-226.

To be quoted for publications of PHD exposure prediction:
  Both papers quoted above.



Definition of accessibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For training the residue solvent accessibility the DSSP (Dictionary of
Secondary Structure of Proteins; Kabsch & Sander (1983) Biopolymers, 22,
2577-2637) values of accessible surface area have been used.  The
prediction provides values for the relative solvent accessibility.  The
normalisation is the following:

|                           ACCESSIBILITY (from DSSP in Angstrom)
|RELATIVE_ACCESSIBILITY =   ------------------------------------- * 100
|                               MAXIMAL_ACC (amino acid type i)

where MAXIMAL_ACC (i) is the maximal accessibility of amino acid type i.
The maximal values are:

+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|  A |  B |  C |  D |  E |  F |  G |  H |  I |  K |  L |  M |
| 106| 160| 135| 163| 194| 197|  84| 184| 169| 205| 164| 188|
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|  N |  P |  Q |  R |  S |  T |  V |  W |  X |  Y |  Z |
| 157| 136| 198| 248| 130| 142| 142| 227| 180| 222| 196|
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

Notation: one letter code for amino acid, B stands for D or N; Z stands
  for E or Q; and X stands for undetermined.

The relative solvent accessibility can be used to estimate the number
of water molecules (W) in contact with the residue:

W = ACCESSIBILITY /10

The prediction is given in 10 states for relative accessibility, with

RELATIVE_ACCESSIBILITY = (PREDICTED_ACC * PREDICTED_ACC)

where PREDICTED_ACC = 0 - 9.



Estimated Accuracy of Prediction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A careful cross validation test on some 238 protein chains (in total
about 62,000 residues) with less than 25% pairwise sequence identity
gave the following results:


Correlation
...........

The correlation between observed and predicted solvent accessibility
is:

-----------
corr = 0.53
-----------

This value ought to be compared to the worst and best case prediction
scenario: random prediction (corr = 0.0) and homology modelling
(corr = 0.66).  (Note: homology modelling yields a relative accurate
prediction in 3D if, and only if, a significantly identical sequence
has a known 3D structure.)


3-state accuracy
................

Often the relative accessibility is projected onto, e.g., 3 states:
  b  = buried       (here defined as < 9% relative accessibility),
  i  = intermediate ( 9% <= rel. acc. < 36% ),
  e  = exposed      ( rel. acc. >= 36% ).

A projection onto 3 states or 2 states (buried/exposed) enables the
compilation of a 3- and 2-state prediction accuracy.  PHD reaches an
overall 3-state accuracy of:
  Q3 = 57.5%
(compared to 35% for random prediction and 70% for homology modelling).

In detail:

+-----------------------------------+-------------------------+
| Qburied       (% of observed)=77% | Qb (% of predicted)=60% |
| Qintermediate (% of observed)= 9% | Qi (% of predicted)=44% |
| Qexposed      (% of observed)=78% | Qe (% of predicted)=56% |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------+


10-state accuracy
.................

The network predicts relative solvent accessibility in 10 states, with
state i (i = 0-9) corresponding to a relative solvent accessibility of
i*i %.  The 10-state accuracy of the network is:

  Q10 = 24.5%

..........................................................................

These percentages are defined by:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|                     number of correctly predicted residues
|Q3               = ---------------------------------------      (*100)
|                           number of all residues
|
|                     no of res. correctly predicted to be buried
|Qburied (% of obs) = ------------------------------------------- (*100)
|                     no of all res. observed to be buried
|
|
|                     no of res. correctly predicted to be buried
|Qburied (% of pred)= ------------------------------------------- (*100)
|                     no of all residues predicted to be buried

..........................................................................

Averaging over single chains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most reasonable way to compute the overall accuracies is the above
quoted percentage of correctly predicted residues.  However, since the
user is mainly interested in the expected performance of the prediction
for a particular protein, the mean value when averaging over protein
chains might be of help as well.  Computing first the correlation
between observed and predicted accessibility for each protein chan, and
then averaging over all 238 chains yields the following average:

+-------------------------------====--+
| corr/averaged over chains   = 0.53  |
+-------------------------------====--+
| standard deviation          = 0.11  |
+-------------------------------------+

Note: This table is to be read in the following manner:
     8611 of all residues predicted to be in exposed by 0%, were
     observed with 0% relative accessibility.  However, 325 of all
     residues predicted to have 0% are observed as completely exposed
     (obs = 9 -> rel. acc. >= 81%).  The term "observed" refers to the
     DSSP compilation of area of solvent accessibility calculated from
     3D coordinates of experimentally determined structures (Diction-
     ary of Secondary Structure  of Proteins: Kabsch & Sander (1983)

Position-specific reliability index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The network predicts the 10 states for relative accessibility using real
numbers from the output units. The prediction is assigned by choosing
the maximal unit ("winner takes all").  However, the real numbers
contain additional information.
E.g. the difference between the maximal and the second largest output
unit (with the constraint that the second largest output is compiled
among all units at least 2 positions off the maximal unit) can be used
to derive a "reliability index".  This index is given for each residue
along with the prediction.  The index is scaled to have values between
0 (lowest reliability), and 9 (highest).
The accuracies (Q3, corr, asf.) to be expected for residues with values
above a particular value of the index are given below as well as the
fraction of such residues (%res).:

The above table gives the cumulative results, e.g. 45.8% of all
residues have a reliability of at least 4.  The correlation for this
most reliably predicted half of the residues is 0.686, i.e. a value
comparable to what could be expected if homology modelling were
possible.  For this subset of 45.8% of all residues, 89% of the buried
residues are correctly predicted, and 72% of all residues predicted to
be buried are correct.

Note: This table is to be read in the following manner:
     5214 of all residues predicted to be in a helical trans-membrane
     region, were observed to be in the lipid bilayer, 1050 however
     were observed either inside or outside of the protein, i.e. in
     loop (or non-membrane) regions. The term "observed" refers to DSSP
     assignment of secondary structure calculated from 3D coordinates
     of experimentally determined structures (Dictionary of Secondary
     Structure  of Proteins: Kabsch & Sander (1983) Biopolymers, 22,
     2577-2637) where these were available.  For all other proteins,
     the assignment of trans-membrane segments has been taken from the
     Swissprot data bank (Bairoch, A.; Boeckmann, B.: The SWISS-PROT
     protein sequence data bank. Nucl. Acids Res. 20: 2019-2022, 1992).

+-----------------+---------------+----------------+
|   Sov total     |      86.0%    |      96.8%     |
+-----------------+---------------+----------------+

     Definition of Sov in: Rost et al., JMB, 1994, 235, 13-26.

     As helical trans-membrane segments are longer than globular heli-
     ces, correctly predicted segments can easily be made out.  PHDhtm
     misses 5 out of 258 observed segments, predicts 6 where non is
     observed and 3 times the predicted helical segment overlaps two
     observed regions.  Thus, in total more than 95% of all segments
     are correctly predicted.

Position-specific reliability index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The network predicts two states: helical trans-membrane region and rest
using two output units.  The prediction is assigned by choosing the ma-
ximal unit ("winner takes all").  However, the real numbers of the out-
put units contain additional information.
E.g. the difference between the two output units can be used to derive
a "reliability index".  This index is given for each residue along with
the prediction.  The index is scaled to have values between 0 (lowest
reliability), and 9 (highest).
The accuracies (Qtot) to be expected for residues with values above a
particular value of the index are given below as well as the fraction
of such residues (%res).:

+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| index|  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |
| %res |100.0| 98.8| 97.3| 95.9| 94.1| 92.3| 89.9| 86.2| 75.0| 66.8|

|      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Qtot | 94.7| 95.2| 95.6| 96.2| 96.7| 97.2| 97.7| 98.4| 99.4| 99.8|
|      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| H%obs| 91.8| 92.9| 93.8| 94.4| 95.0| 95.7| 96.2| 96.8| 95.5| 78.7|
| L%obs| 95.3| 95.7| 96.1| 96.6| 97.0| 97.5| 98.1| 98.8| 99.7|100.0|
|      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| H%prd| 82.7| 83.8| 85.0| 86.7| 88.1| 89.7| 91.4| 93.8| 96.3| 97.1|
| L%prd| 97.9| 98.3| 98.5| 98.7| 98.8| 99.0| 99.2| 99.4| 99.7| 99.9|
+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

The above table gives the cumulative results, e.g. 92.3% of all
residues have a reliability of at least 5.  The overall two-state
accuracy for this subset is 97.2%.  For this subset, e.g., 95.7% of
the observed helical trans-membrane residues are correctly predicted,
and 89.7% of all residues predicted to be in helical trans-membrane
segment are correct.







The resulting network (PHD) prediction is:

---                                                                       ---
---      as of  January 1, 1997,  EMBL has effectively decided to not     ---
---   support the PredictProtein service by personal resources.  I do     ---
---   maintain the program, so to speak, in my private time. However,     ---
---   my contract obliges me to do science, instead.   Unfortunately,     ---
---   the computer environment at  EMBL  is at the same time starting     ---
---   to become increasingly unstable.   Consequence of these two re-     ---
---   cent developments is that the  PredictProtein service is not as     ---
---   stable as it was.                                                   ---
---                                                                       ---
---      I apologise for the problems this may cause.  In particular,     ---
---   I apologise for my inability to reply to the 20-30 daily,  per-     ---
---   sonal mails, and suggest to  re-submit requests after 24 hours!     ---
---                                                                       ---
---   Hoping  that I shall  find  a more convenient  solution for the     ---
---   future of the PredictProtein I remain with my best regards,         ---
---                                                                       ---
