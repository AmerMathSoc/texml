% \begin{abstract}
% This \nddiss\space class is based on the standard \LaTeXe\/ \textsf{book}
% class and is an extensive rewrite of the earlier \textsf{NDthesis} class
% file, incorporating changes for \LaTeXe\space  and pdf\LaTeX\space as well
% as many other improvements.  This class conforms with the requirements of the
% Graduate School guidelines published in Spring 2004 for the layout of the Ph.D.
% dissertations and Master's theses.  In reading this documentation you will
% find that I assume that the
% reader has working knowledge of \LaTeXe\/.

%
% \section{Introduction}
% \label{sec:intro}
% This document describes the \LaTeXe\space document class \nddiss,
% suitable\footnote{In my opinion, but with no guarantee that you or other users
% will agree. I shall not be liable for any consequence, good or bad,
% of anyone's use of this software.} for producing dissertations and
% theses according to the Spring 2004 guidelines of the Graduate School at the
% University of Notre Dame. The latest version of this class and
% related documentation should be
% available at \url{http://www.gsu.nd.edu} or at
% \url{http://graduateschool.nd.edu}.
%
% \subsection{Disclaimer}
% \label{sec:disclaimer}
% It could be thought of as suspicious if I begin with a disclaimer, but it is
% important for you to keep in mind that only
% {\em You} are responsible for the correct formatting of the document
% even though use of this class simplifies this task considerably. There
% are certain formatting things which need to be done manually and are
% described later in section \ref{sec:author}.
% As such, this class and its associated
% documentation {\em must not} be assumed to be a replacement of the
% formatting guide from the Graduate School and the official guide must be
% consulted, in case of doubt.
%
% In short, no one but you (the user) accepts any responsibility for works
% that do not get approved by the Graduate School. Use of the
% \nddiss\space class file implicitly states acceptance of this policy. Having
% said that, a document produced by using this class (as described in the
% following sections) has a pretty good likelyhood
% of being accepted as it is.
%
% \subsection{Dependencies and Limitations}
% \label{sec:deps}
% This classfile depends on many other packages to be present in either
% the |TEXMF| tree (system or local) or the \LaTeX\space search path (defined by shell variable
% \verb+$TEXINPUTS+). A list of the essential packages is mentioned in section \ref{sec:features}.
%
% Although I have tested it with \LaTeX\space
% [2001/06/01], it should be backwards compatible with \LaTeX\space
% [1995/12/01] and higher
% as well. It is not possible for me to list the version of each
% package used within the class file and you might get errors if the package in
% your |TEXMF| tree is outdated.
%
% The classfile is limited in the sense that it will produce an acceptable
% document with the packages that I have tried and included by default. There
% are numerous packages you may want to use for your work, but they may have
% to be modified accordingly. Things lacking include support
% for {\sffamily subfigure} package and proper formatting of the captions in
% such an environment. Formatting of the captions could be much easier with the
% new {\sffamily caption}\footnote{\textsf{caption} package by Axel
% Sommerfeldt v3.0b[2004/05/16] and higher}
% in general, and is a thing-to-do for future versions.
%
%
% \section{Usage}
%
% The \nddiss\space document class can be used only with \LaTeXe\space native mode or
% later, by typing |\documentclass|\oarg{options}|{nddiss2e}| at the
% beginning of your \LaTeX\space source file. The available options for
% the use of the class are discussed in section \ref{subsec:options} below.
% These have been limited to a small number in order to obtain documents
% with similar formatting under \LaTeXe\space using this class, although the
% \nddiss\space class is based on the \textsf{book} class,
% which has many other options.
%
% \subsection{Options}
% \label{subsec:options}
%
% By default, all documents produced using this class
% are formatted in |letterpaper| size and |onesided|,
% |doublespaced| mode, as per
% the requirements of the Graduate School. If you wish to override these
% restrictions, appropriate changes to the class file
% would be needed.
%
% The most important of the options is |draft|, |review| or
% |final|. Exactly one of
% these {\em must} be used, otherwise you would surely get errors.
%
% \DescribeMacro{draft}
% Using |draft| option will enable the {\it draft} mode of the
% |book| class, thus making the processing of the document
% faster. As a result of this, the most visible change is that instead of the
% included figure, only its placement box is displayed. An appropriate header
% is included to indicate that the prepared document is a draft document. The
% purpose of the |draft| option is to obtain a fast and preliminary
% document showing the labels for citations, tables, figures etc. and a black
% solid rule highlighting the horizontal overflows. Such a document would be
% the one you would prepare for revising your text during writing stages.
%
% \DescribeMacro{review}
% The |review| option makes it possible to prepare a document that is
% one step closer to the final version. Almost all the formatting of final
% version is present, along with the labels and keys as in the |draft|
% option. A document prepared with |review| option would be the one to
% check for proper formatting and giving to your advisor if (s)he wished to
% suggest corrections.
%
% \DescribeMacro{final}
% The |final| style option will produce the
% document for the production of archival
% copies of the dissertation for submission to the Graduate School.
%
% \DescribeMacro{twoadvisors}
% If you have more than one advisor for your project/research, selecting the
% |twoadvisors| option
% would produce an appropriately formatted titlepage. The |\secondadvisor|
% macro command is used to specify the name of the second advisor.
%
% \DescribeMacro{numrefs}
% \DescribeMacro{textrefs}
% Exactly one of these options -- |numrefs| or |textrefs|,
% needs to be specified. |numrefs| results in a
% numbered citation sytle with {\sffamily natbib} and ``nddiss2e'' citation style
% file\footnote{|nddiss2e.bst| is a slight modificiation of |abbrvnat.bst|
% in the {\sffamily natbib} package}.
% Using |textrefs| changes the citation style to be similar to
% ``author-date'' style with the same files. If none of these options is
% specified, the default style of numbered citations (ie.\/ same as if
% |numrefs| was used) is used.
%
% Since the same set of package and
% style file results in differing citation format, it is {\em strongly}
% suggested to
% refer to the documentation |natnotes.dvi| in your |TEXMF| tree,
% to be aware of the
% various ways in which you can make a citation in your text.
%
% \DescribeMacro{10pt}
% \DescribeMacro{11pt}
% \DescribeMacro{12pt}
% The choice of the fontsize is only applicable with the |draft| option
% used. By default, the document will be prepared in the 10pt size for the
% |draft|
% style option. For the |review| and the |final| style options,
% the document is prepared in the 12pt fontsize and choosing any other fontsize
% option will be ignored.
%
% \DescribeMacro{noinfo}
% Using the |noinfo| option would disable the information page produced
% when the |review| or |final| style options are used. It is
% recommended that you do not disable the ``info'' page unless it is the final
% most copy/copies for submission to the Graduate School.
%
% Thus, |\documentclass[draft,12pt]{nddiss2e}| would produce a document in
% \textsf{draft} format in 12pt font size and \\
% |\documentclass[final,twoadvisors]{nddiss2e}|
% would produce a document (with modified title page) for final submission
% to the Graduate School.
%
% \section{Features}
% \label{sec:features}
% A number of packages are required by default and must be present in your
% \TeX\space search path. As far as possible, these have been tested for proper
% formatting style with the \nddiss\/ class file. The list includes
% \textsf{ifthen},
% \textsf{exscale},
% \textsf{xspace},
% \textsf{longtable},
% \textsf{indentfirst},
% \textsf{tabularx},
% \textsf{showkeys},
% \textsf{enumerate},
% \textsf{latexsym}.
% \textsf{epsfig},
% \textsf{color},
% \textsf{graphicx},
% \textsf{url},
% \textsf{setspace}\footnote{v6.7[2000/12/01] or above},
% \textsf{amsmath},
% \textsf{amssymb},
% \textsf{float},
% \textsf{lscape},
% \textsf{rotating},
% \textsf{booktabs} and
% \textsf{natbib}.
% I urge you to read the documentation of these packages available in
% the |TEXMF| tree, if you think you might use their features
% or want to tweak some advanced options.
%
% Other packages may or may not be appropriate for use with the
% \nddiss\space class when producing copies to be submitted to the
% Graduate School. Please be careful when using packages that change the
% default fonts, or the layout(s).
%
% In general, the official guidelines of the Graduate School are
% followed to as much extent as possible. This includes proper
% formatting of the title page and the abstract page (from the
% \textsf{ndthesis} package), numbering of the pages in the {\it
% frontmatter}, generation of properly formatted table of contents, list
% of figures etc., as well as bibliography at the end. As per the guide,
% number of different fonts and font sizes used in the thesis is kept to
% a minimum. The contents, all lists and the bibliography are
% single-spaced but the inter-line spacing for the rest of the document
% is double.
%
% \subsection{Generating PDF document}
% \label{subsec:pdfdoc}
%
% The \nddiss\space class also allows production of pdf documents with
% pdf\LaTeX\space.  In this case, the \textsf{hyperref} and
% \textsf{hypernat} packages are also required. These packages ensure
% that the generated pdf document contains internal as well as external
% links for citations and bookmarks. A document produced by this method
% also contains embedded fonts ({\it press quality} pdf) and is suitable
% for electronic submission to the library and for microfilm archiving.
% Although the most appropriate options for the \textsf{hyperref} are
% passed on, for advanced features refer to its documentation.
%
% For creating documents with figures, it is imperative that these are
% present in a pdf-like format (eg.\/ pdf or metapost) rather than
% the usual encapsulated postscript (eps)
% format. An easy way to convert your {\it eps} files to {\it pdf} files
% is to use the utility |epstopdf| or |eps2pdf|, which should be
% available on your unix-like distribution already.
%
% \section{Arrangement of contents}
%
% A dissertation or a thesis document must contain the following parts,
% in the order listed. Only those explicitly marked as optional may be
% omitted. Again, I must point out that the official guide must be
% referred and its guidelines override the order listed here.
%
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Title Page
% \item Copyright page
% \item Abstract {\em (optional for Master's thesis)}
% \item Dedication {\em(optional)}
% \item Table of Contents
% \item List of Figures
% \item List of Tables
% \item List Symbols {\em (optional)}
% \item Preface {\em (optional)}
% \item Acknowledgments {\em (optional)}
% \item Text
% \item Appendix (or Appendices) {\em (optional)}
% \item Bibliography (or References, or Works cited)
% \end{enumerate}
%
% The macros and environments described below ease the formatting of these
% parts.
%
% \subsection{Title page}
%
% The title page is generated by the standard
% \LaTeX\space macro |\maketitle| with no arguments.
% This macro has been modified for providing a title page format
% required for dissertations/theses.
%
% Prior to invoking it in
% your document, you should declare --
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \DescribeMacro{\title\{\}} the title of the document using the
% |\title| macro (note: title must be in ALL caps, eg.
% |\title{THIS IS \||\ A TITLE IN TWO LINES}|, and you may use
% linebreaks within the title),
% \item \DescribeMacro{\author\{\}} your name (full and exactly as
% registered with the Graduate School) with the
% |\author| macro, (eg. |\author{Gary Graham Gordon-Graeme}|),
% \item \DescribeMacro{\work\{\}} whether the document is a {\em Thesis} or a {\em
% Dissertation} as
% argument of |\work| macro, (eg. |\work{Dissertation}|),
% \item \DescribeMacro{\degaward\{\}} the degree you're aiming for (in
% full) with the |\degaward| macro, (eg. |\degaward{Doctor of Philosophy}| or
% |\degaward{Master of Science\\in\\Engineering}|),
% \item \DescribeMacro{\degprior\{\}} all your prior degrees to go with your name
% with |\degprior| macro, (eg. |\degprior{B. S., M. S.}|),
% \item \DescribeMacro{\advisor\{\}} the name of your advisor as argument to
% |\advisor| macro,
% \item \DescribeMacro{\secondadvisor\{\}} the name of second advisor, if any, with
% |\secondadvisor| macro \footnote{this macro is necessary when,
% \textsf{twoadvisors} option is used while invoking \nddiss\space class},
% \item \DescribeMacro{\department\{\}} the name of the department in the
% argument of the |\department| macro,
% (eg. |\department{Gnulogical Engineering}|) and,
% \item \DescribeMacro{\degdate\{\}} the month and year of the defense of the
% thesis with the |\degdate| (eg. |\degdate{June 2004}|). If you forget to
% declare this, the current month/year combination will be automatically used.
% \end{itemize}
%
% \DescribeMacro{\maketitle}
% After defining the above macro arguments, use |\maketitle| to generate
% a title page, which includes your entries.  All the above macros are
% required and if missing, they may result in errors in the generation
% of the title page.
%
% \subsection{Copyright page}
% \DescribeMacro{\makecopyright}
% \DescribeMacro{\makepublicdomain}
% The |\makecopyright| macro should be invoked after |\maketitle| to
% produce a copyright page. Alternatively, you can use
% |\makepublicdomain| to produce a page with the message ``This document
% is in the public domain.'' Note that the absence of the copyright page
% does {\em not} place your dissertaion in the public domain, you must
% declare it as such explicitely.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\copyrightholder\{\}}
% \DescribeMacro{\copyrightyear\{\}}
% Prior to calling |\makecopyright|, you may specify a different name
% for the copyright holder (the default is the name given through the
% |\author| macro) and for the copyright year (the default being the
% current year). You should do this with |\copyrightholder|\marg{name}
% and |\copyrightyear|\marg{year} macros.
%
% \subsection{Abstract page(s)} \DescribeEnv{abstract}
% The \textsf{abstract} environment has been modified from the default
% in the \textsf{report} class to comply with the requirements
% of the Graduate School. The abstract text should be placed between
% |\begin{abstract}| and |\end{abstract}|.
% In this environment, the author's name is placed in
% the top-right header, if it exceeds one page.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\abstractname\{\}}
% You may use |\abstractname|\marg{text} to change the abstract caption
% to |text|.
% Default name: |Abstract|.
%
% \subsection{Dedication}
%
% \DescribeEnv{dedication}
% The format of dedication is essentially free, but you may want to use
% the \textsf{dedication} environment for this purpose. This environment
% will center the text of your dedication vertically on the page. The
% dedication is optional.
% \DescribeMacro{\dedicationame\{\}}
% |\dedicationname|\marg{text} may be used to change the title for the
% dedication page. Default name: |\mbox{}| ie.\/ an empty title.
%
% \subsection{Table of contents, figures and tables}
% \DescribeMacro{\tableofcontents}
% \DescribeMacro{\listoffigures}
% \DescribeMacro{\listoftables}
% Use the macros |\tableofcontents|,|\listoffigures| and |\listoftables|
% in this order, to produce the required table of contents and list of
% figures and tables. (Note: the ``list of figures'' should precede the
% ``list of tables'' as per the Graduate School guide)
%
% \DescribeMacro{\contentsname\{\}}
% \DescribeMacro{\listfigurename\{\}}
% \DescribeMacro{\listtablename\{\}}
% The macros |\contentsname|, |\listfigurename| and |\listtablename| may
% be used to change the caption for Table of Contents, List of Figures
% and List of Tables, respectively. By default, they are named as |CONTENTS|,
% |FIGURES| and |TABLES|.
%
% \subsection{List of symbols}
% \DescribeEnv{symbols} The \textsf{symbols} environment is useful in
% formatting the list of symbols/abbreviations used in your work. It
% takes optional argument specifying the desired format, eg.
% |\begin{symbols}[cl]| for first column centered and the next column
% aligned left.  \DescribeMacro{\symbolsname\{\}} As earlier, the
% caption for the list of symbols can be changed by using the
% |\symbolsname| macro. Default name: |SYMBOLS|
%
% \DescribeMacro{\sym\{\}\{\}}
% Another macro |\sym|\marg{symbol}\marg{definition} makes the task of
% entering the symbols and their meanings in the \textsf{symbols}
% environment easier. |\sym| takes two arguments - first, a math
% ``object'' and second, assumed to be the plain text describing the
% symbol. Any plain text in the first argument needs to be set with
% |\mathrm{..}| and any math symbol in the second needs to placed in
% |$..$|.  Example: |\sym{\beta_\mathrm{norm}}{Definition for $\beta$}|
%
% \subsection{Preface}
% \DescribeEnv{preface}
% \DescribeMacro{\prefacename\{\}}
% An environment \textsf{preface} is provided for formatting the preface to the
% document.  The name of this {\em chapter} may be changed by |\prefacename|
% macro. Default name: |PREFACE|
%
% \subsection{Acknowledgments}
% \DescribeEnv{acknowledgments}
% \DescribeMacro{\acknowledgename\{\}}
% The environment \textsf{acknowledgments} is used to format the
% acknowledgment {\em chapter}. As above |\acknowledgename| macro may be used
% to change the title name. Default name: |ACKNOWLEDGMENTS|.
%
% \subsection{Text} \DescribeMacro{\mainmatter}
% Use the macro |\mainmatter| at the beginning of the text sections ie.
% all text matter should follow this macro as in the {\sffamily book}
% class. The text is formatted in |\normalspacing| ie. double-spacing.
% The pages are numbered in |plain| pagestyle such that the page numbers
% are centered in the bottom. The |chapter| titles can be multi-line or
% long and would be formatted doubly spaced.
%
% \subsection{Appendix}
% \DescribeMacro{\appendix}
% As in the {\sffamily book} class, use the |\appendix| to mark the
% end of the last chapter in the main section and the start of the
% appendices. To begin an appendix, using a |\chapter|\marg{title}
% macro. Appendices will be automatically ``numbered'' alphabetically.
%
% \subsection{Backmatter}
% \DescribeMacro{\backmatter}
% This macro separates the bibliography, index
% and glossary from the main matter and appendices, if any.
%
% \subsection{Bibliography} \DescribeMacro{\bibliography}
% You may use the |\bibliography|\marg{bibfile} macro to generate the
% bibliography with \BibTeX\/. In order to use the
% \BibTeX\/ path for generating bibliography, one needs to have
% all the bibliographic data in \BibTeX\/  files. You should
% refer to \BibTeX\/ manual for details about making a |.bib| file
% and format for the entries.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\bibname\{\}} The default name for this {\em chapter} is
% |BIBLIOGRAPHY|. You may change it by using the macro command
% |\bibname|\marg{newbibname}.
%
% \DescribeEnv{thebibliography}
% Alternatively, you can also make your own bibliography by using
% {\sffamily thebibliography} environment. In this case, you would have
% to write the reference entries in the right format in your |.tex| source
% file itself.
%
% For citing references in the text, the package {\sffamily natbib} is
% included with options: \texttt{numbers,sort\&compress} (|numrefs| option) or
% \texttt{authoryear,sort} (|textrefs| option). The package \textsf{natbib} is a
% fantastic package that has numerous macros for {\em citing} in different ways.
% It would make your life a lot easier if you read up its documentation. In
% addition, for generation of pdf document, another package {\sffamily
% hypernat} helps generates internal links for references.
%
% {\bfseries Warning:} The packages {\sffamily cite} and \textsf{citation} are
% NOT compatible
% with the {\sffamily natbib} package, and they must not be used.
%
% \section{Note for the authors}
% \label{sec:author}
% As noted earlier, the dissertation author must make sure that the
% following conditions are met in order to generate a dissertation
% acceptable by the Graduate School:
%
% \begin{itemize}
% \item List of Figures should be {\em before} List of Tables, ie. the
% macro command |\listoffigures| comes before |\listoftables| in the
% frontmatter.
% \item Chapter titles need to be written in ALL CAPS.
% \item Table caption must be {\em above} the table, but the figure
% caption should be {\em below} it.
% In case of {\sffamily table} environment, this can be achieved by
% putting |\caption| before you include the table (eg. in a {\sffamily
% tabular} environment). In the {\sffamily figure} environment, |\caption|
% goes after the |\includegraphics| macro command.
% \item Table captions need to be in ALL CAPS as well.
% \item Bibliography is the last section/chapter of the thesis.\footnote{Except
% if you are using {\em chapter-wise} bibliography}
% \end{itemize}
%
% \subsection{Chapter-wise bibliography}
% It is now possible to obtain bibliography as a section in each chapter
% (as is common
% in some departments esp.\/ humanities) with some minor code
% implementation in the |.tex| files. To do this you have to load the
% package {\sffamily chapterbib} (without any options)
% in the preamble of your main tex file and
% redefine some commands as below -
% \begin{verbatim}
% %% Main source file %%
% \documentclass[...]{nddiss2e}
% \usepackage{chapterbib}
% \renewcommand{\bibname}{Cited works}
% \renewcommand{\bibsection}{\section{\bibname}}
% ...
% \begin{document}
% \include{chptr1}
% ...
% \include{appndx}
% \end{document}
% \end{verbatim}
%
% In such a case, you must separate the chapters or sections in
% which you want individual bibliographies in different files and {\em include}
% them in the main file as above. Each such |\include|d file must contain
% its own |\bibliographystyle{nddiss2e}| and |\bibliography{...}| command at
% an appropriate position. There should not be any bibliographic commands in
% the main source file.
%
% After compiling the main tex file once (with |latex| or
% |pdflatex|)\footnote{This creates |.aux| files which are needed by |bibtex|},
% you
% would have to run |bibtex| on each of the separate files to obtain a |.bbl|
% for each file. The remaining steps are the same as for a normal |.tex| file.
%
% You can find more details of this in
% the {\sffamily natbib} manual (|natbib.dvi|) in the |TEXMF| tree.
% \subsection{Tips and suggestions}
% \label{subsec:tips}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Use |\toprule|, |\midrule| and |\bottomrule| macro commands (from the
% {\sffamily booktabs} package) in the
% tables for generating the appropriate horizontal rules. Use of vertical rules
% to separate columns in tables, is in general, bad style and should be avoided as much as possible.
% \item Use the {\sffamily longtable} environment for handling very long
% tabular materials. Again, use the vertical rules only if very necessary.
% \begin{verbatim}
% \begin{longtable}{lc}
% \caption[]{LONG TABLE CAPTION \label{tab:longtable} }
% \toprule
% Heading 1 & Heading 2 \\

% \item If a figure/table is very wide and will not fit normally,
% use the {\sffamily landscape} environment (from the included {\sffamily lscape}
% package) to format them in {\em landscape}
% mode. They will automatically appear on a separate page.
% The {\sffamily sidewaystable} environment (from the included {\sffamily
% rotating} package) is incompatible with the current
% class and must be avoided.
% \item Usually the width of the figure/table captions is 90\% of the textwidth
% (ie. |0.9\textwidth|),
% but if needed can be changed as per the following:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Use a {\sffamily minipage} environment of appropriate width and enclose
% your tabular or figure float inside it, or
% \item set the |\capwidth| inside the {\sffamily table} or the
% {\sffamily figure} environment, and |\LTcapwidth| {\em outside} the {\sffamily
% longtable} environment, e.g.,\\[\baselineskip]
% \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
% \begin{verbatim}
% \begin{table}[H]
% \setlength{\capwidth}{0.8\textwidth}
% \centering
% \caption{TABLE CAP\label{tab:this}}
% \begin{tabular}{lc}
% ...
% \end{tabular}

% \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
% \begin{verbatim}
% \setlength{\LTcapwidth}{6in}
% \begin{longtable}{lccc}
% ...
% \end{\longtable}
% \end{verbatim}
% \end{minipage}
% \end{itemize}
% \item Use {\sffamily tabularx} environment for the actual
% formatting of the tables (within the \textsf{table} environment). It differ
% slightly from \textsf{tabular} environment and you should refer to their
% documentation in the |TEXMF| tree for more information.
% \item If you've used a {\sffamily longtable} environment in your document,
% it might be
% necessary to compile the document multiple times so as to get proper
% alignment of columns. This is documented in the {\sffamily longtable} manual.
% \item If you wish to use |\footnotes| in the \textsf{longtable} environment,
% please read its documentation. There are some handicaps present.
% \item A new macro command |\subsubsection| (self-explanatory) has been defined.
% It is numbered as |3.2.1.4| in the TOC.
% \item To cite a website in your bibliography\footnote{More info at
% \url{http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=citeURL}}, use the
% following format in your |.bib| file:
%  \begin{verbatim}
%      @Misc{fairley2000,
%      author =       "N. Fairley",
%      title =        "Casa{XPS} {VAMAS} processing software",
%      howpublished = "Website",
%      note =         "\url{http://www.casaxps.com}",
%      }
%  \end{verbatim} This when processed with the |nddiss2e.bst| citation style file
% gives:\newline
% 111. N. Fairley. CasaXPS VAMAS processing software. Website.
% \url{http://www.casaxps.com}.\newline
% \end{itemize}
%
% \subsection{You found errors?}
% If you find some errors in formatting of your document, most likely these are
% NOT due to the \nddiss\/ class, but due to either wrongly used
% commands/macros or conflicting commands/macros in a package that you might
% have used ie.\/ a mistake from your side. Please verify that before
% contacting anyone regarding the class file.
%
% Read the manuals for the packages that you might have used and find out if
% they have macro commands that modify the page-layout, spacing etc.\/ or if
% they conflict with already defined commands (eg.\/ packages
% \textsf{natbib} and
% \textsf{cite} redefine the same command |\cite| in different ways). I would
% suggest that you {\em read the manuals anyway}! It is a good practice.
%
% In the possible scenario that you
% have found a significant error, please try to find out the source of the
% error and, even better, a possible alternative, please
% report it to the Graduate School's reviewer(s). It would also be great, if
% you try to find a solution for the problem and inform that as well.
% Please also inform if you find this documentation confusing or misleading or
% if any mistakes are present.
%
% Your doing so will ensure that the reviwer(s) are aware of the problem and
% its possible solutions and they can give better answers to the people who
% might encounter similar problems. It will also help making the future
% versions of the class file better.
%
% \section{Example}
% Below is a basic |.tex| sample for your help.
% A file called |template.tex|\footnote{Most likely present in the same
% directory as |nddiss2e.cls| ie.\/ in |TEXMF/tex/latex/nddiss2e/|}
% is generated from |nddiss2e.ins| which might serve as a guide for
% your document. The |example| directory contains a mock thesis modified
% from {\sffamily ndthesis} classfile and should also be helpful.
