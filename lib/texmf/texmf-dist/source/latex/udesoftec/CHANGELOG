The version number of all files is changed for every release. Please refer to the details below in order to see which files were changed.

2015/09/04 v1.5.2
* [udesoftec.cls] Regression: \acadmicfield was dropped from default title page
* [udesoftec.bst] repaired doi error parsing
* [udesoftec-bibcommon.sty] automatic prefixing of pages for BibTeX: if page is numeric add prefix, else use string supplied instead of page, e.g. \cite[43-56]{Bib} for citing "pp. 42-56" and \cite[B.2]{Bib} to cite "B.2" of a document without pages. In order to reproduce old behavior use: \renewcommand*{\bblInTextPagePrefix}[1]{}
 
2015/08/27 v1.5.1
* Improving interop between BibTeX and BibLaTeX styles
* [udesoftec-biblatex.sty] adapting formating to remove major bugs  
* [udesoftec.cls] switching class mapping of "en" to "british" instead of "english" for better date representation
 
2015/08/25 v1.5.0 (unreleased)
* Big code sprint and bugfixing!
* [udesoftec.bst] fixed order of elements in biblography
* [udesoftec.cls] major cleanup and reordering of cls file
* [udesoftec-bst.sty] fixed wrong font size after first ISBN/ISSN in bibliography
* NEW [udesoftec-biblatex.sty] adding basic support in the architecture of the class for biblatex. Currently the citations are barely how they should look like and the package is highly experimental.
* NEW [udesoftec-bibcommon.sty] provide basic support for bibtex/bst and biber/bbx/biblatex to use the same commands for design of citations and bibliography, will be included automatically by udesoftec-bst and udesoftec-biblatex
* [udesoftec-bibcommon.sty] provide support for reformating the dates in bibliography for urldate or techstandards. Dates should have the format "yyyy-mm-dd" or "dd.mm.yyyy". A bit of robustness is coded in, due to different exports having different date formats. In case you run into errors, feel free to report your date format.

* [udesoftec-bst.sty] added option for page prefix of in-text-citations (e.g. to switch easily between German 'S.' and English 'p')
