% \begin{abstract} \textsf{poemscol} provides macros for \LaTeX\ for
% setting collections of poetry.  It is especially suited for setting
% collections of poetry in which several volumes are combined, such as
% in a critical edition of a poet's Collected Poems.  It provides the
% structures required to produce a critical edition of the kind
% specified by the Modern Language Association's Committee on
% Scholarly Editions, and it automatically marks every occasion where
% a stanza break falls on a page break.  \end{abstract}
% \tableofcontents \hfuzz=50pt \section{Introduction}
% 
% \textsf{poemscol} provides the structures necessary for editing a
% critical edition of a volume of poems or of a collection of a poet's
% works.  \textsf{poemscol} numbers the lines, and produces separate,
% formatted endnote sections for emendations, textual collations, and
% explanatory notes (or, optionally, multi-layered footnotes), tying
% each note to the number of the line upon which it is a comment.  It
% also automatically generates a table of contents, an index of titles
% and first lines, and divider pages for the sections of the volumes.
% It produces running headers of the form ``Emendations to pp.~xx-yy''
% for the note sections.  And it marks occasions when a stanza break
% falls at a page break.
% 
% Producing line numbers for verse is something for which \LaTeX\
% would seem to be especially suited.  A line of verse, after all, is
% not a carriage return but a logical unit, an element of
% versification more than of typesetting, perhaps running over several
% physical lines, or perhaps split into half-lines as speakers or
% subjects change.  With \textsf{poemscol} you mark lines, stanzas,
% and entire poems up as logical units, and \LaTeX\ does the
% formatting and counting.  Once you have marked out the logical units
% of the poem, \textsf{poemscol} will automatically mark every textual
% note, emendation, or explanatory note with the range of line 
% numbers to which it applies. 
%
% In poetry which does not have a regular stanzaic form, it is useful
% to be able to mark automatically occasions where there is a stanza
% break at the bottom of a page which the reader might not notice. 
% Doing this by hand is not only tedious and easy to get wrong, but
% also a process you will have to start over again if anything about
% your volume changes, if you add a poem, say, or even decide to break
% a title across two lines.  \textsf{poemscol} takes care of this
% process, so that the editor need never worry about it, automatically
% marking cases where the page break coincides with a stanza break
% with a symbol. 
% 
% Editions of Collected Poetry might also require special structures
% to reflect the fact that they are made up of the contents of several
% volumes of poetry.  In particular, such editions require special
% structures for setting up specially formatted divider pages between
% volumes. They also require tables of contents and other front matter. 
% \textsf{poemscol} provides these structures.
% 
% The best features of \textsf{poemscol} are of course simply that it 
% is \TeX: it uses \TeX's automatic kerning and setting of ligatures, 
% its algorithm for justifying lines (in prose sections), and \LaTeX's 
% way of setting verse.
% 
% Using \LaTeX\ to typeset critical editions offers more advantages
% than simply the ability to automate tedious and easy to fumble
% tasks.  Modern \TeX\ compilers have the ability to produce
% output in Adobe pdf format.  Adobe pdf output can be used as camera
% ready copy, saving your publisher time and expense, and perhaps
% making a marginally economic critical edition a bit easier to bring
% to press.  Furthermore, since typesetting the edition yourself in
% \LaTeX\ obviates the publisher's own typesetting of your text, it
% removes another possible source of new errors.  (You should expect
% to work with your publisher on the final design of the book, but
% \LaTeX\ is a flexible language which will enable you to reproduce
% most book designs.) 
%
% Editions made in the formats of proprietary software such as
% QuarkXPress\copyright\ or InDesign\copyright\ will become not only obsolete
% but unreadable if those programs pass from use.  Since your \LaTeX\
% sources for your edition are in ASCII, or perhaps Unicode, they provide a permanent
% record of your local intentions at every point in your edition,
% whether or not those who wish to consult your files have access to a
% \LaTeX\ compiler, or indeed whether or not they can read \LaTeX\
% code.
%
% Finally, although \LaTeX\ is a typesetting language, not a content
% markup language, the ability to create new commands which the
% language offers comes very close to enabling one to realize the
% ideal of completely separating content markup from formatting.  One
% advantage of this kind of markup is that even if the appearance of
% the poem on the page may be ambiguous, the editor's intentions about
% the logical structure of the poem will be preserved in the \LaTeX\
% source. Should you wish later to produce an electronic edition of
% your work, either using XML or the SGML markup approved by the Text
% Encoding Initiative, transforming your texts from \LaTeX\ to XML
% would largely (although not entirely) be a matter of performing a
% series of global search-and-replaces, and could conceivably be done
% with a perl script.
% 
% \textsf{poemscol} is also suited for verse drama, and the package
% \textsf{dramatist} has been modified to work with \textsf{poemscol}.
% \textsf{poemscol} can provide line numbers and notes for prose
% sections such as the author's introduction or prose poetry, and it
% can also handle inset prose passages in the midst of verse.
% \textsf{poemscol} is not, however, designed for typesetting large
% scale prose works, although very possibly it could be tweaked to 
% work.  For critical editions of prose works, several
% other packages are available, including the \texttt{EDMAC} format, a
% \TeX\ format analogous to but distinct from \LaTeX, by John
% Lavagnino and Dominik Wujastyk, or \textsf{ledmac}, a port of
% \texttt{EDMAC} into \LaTeX\  originally by Peter Wilson and
% now maintained  as \textsf{eledmac} by Ma\"{\i}eul Rouquette, or \textsf{ednotes}, a
% completely independent set of macros for critical editions which
% builds on \textsf{manypar} and \textsf{lineno}, by Uwe L\"{u}ck.
% 
% \section{Dependencies and compatibility with other packages}
%
%\subsection{~General}
% \textsf{poemscol} depends upon several other packages, which you
% should be sure you have in your preamble and search path: 
% \textsf{fancyhdr} for managing the running headers, \textsf{makeidx}
% and \textsf{multicol} for managing the index, \textsf{geometry}, and
% \textsf{ifthen} and \textsf{keyval} to simplify page geometry. 
%
%  If
% you are using the |\JHpoemtitle| alternate form of the |\poemtitle|
% command, you need to add \textsf{mparhack} to your package list, to
% make sure that the marginal references |\JHpoemtitle| adds appear on
% the correct side of the page.  You should make sure that
% \textsf{poemscol} is the very last package you load in your
% preamble, or at least is loaded after those packages upon which it
% depends.
% 
% If you are planning to generate multiple indices, substitute 
% \textsf{splitindex} for \textsf{makeidx} in your list of packages.
% 
%
% \subsection{~Prose sections}
% If you plan to number lines in prose contexts, and to make textual
% notes, emendations, or explanatory notes in prose contexts, you will
% need to add the \textsf{lineno} package to your preamble.  I use the
% ``right'' and ``modulo'' options with this package, but you can set
% the options however you wish to make how you number the lines of
% prose sections consistent with how you number the lines of verse
% sections. 
%
% \subsection{~Multi-layer footnotes}  If you plan to use
% paragraph-formatted footnotes rather than endnotes, you should load
% \textsf{manyfoot}.  You should load it with the ``ruled,'' and
% ``para'' options.  (\textsf{poemscol's} footnote commands are just a
% wrapper around \textsf{manyfoot}.)  \textsf{manyfoot} inherited some
% of the limitations of \LaTeX\ in dealing with long inserts at the
% end of the page, so you may have to do some fiddling.  As fixes to
% these problems emerge, I will incorporate them into
% \textsf{poemscol}.  \textsf{manyfoot} does not allow multiple
% paragraph footnotes when typesetting in ``para'' mode.  This is
% probably a feature, not a bug, since one would want such notes to be
% set in several paragraphs, rather than running them together into
% one, as \textsf{manyfoot} would naturally want to do in para mode.
% For that reason, I have defined the two traditional classes of note
% in which multiple paragraph notes are likely to appear, ``sources,''
% and ``explanatory notes,'' to be typeset in ``plain'' mode, which
% opens a new paragraph with each note.  If your textual notes or
% emendations sections also have multiple paragraph notes, you should
% re-define them in order to produce footnotes in plain rather than in
% para mode, if you wish to produce footnotes rather than endnotes.
%
% \textsf{manyfoot} sometimes gets into conflicts with other packages
% over the number of |\counts| it uses, causing \LaTeX\ to complain
% that there is no room for a |\newcount|. If this happens, 
% issue |\usepackage{etex}| and |\reserveinserts|.
%
% \subsection{~Verse drama and \textsf{dramatist}}
% Massimiliano Dominici has made his \textsf{dramatist} package
% compatible with \textsf{poemscol}, for which I am very grateful. 
% Versions 1.2a or later of \textsf{dramatist} are compatible with 
% versions 2.3 or later of \textsf{poemscol}. 
%
%
% \subsection{~Parallel Text Editions} If you are using the |\keeptitlestraight|
% hack described below  at \ref{parallelhack}, you should add \textsf{etoolbox}
% to your package list. If you are using the six pre-defined endnote sections
% for parallel text editions (|\rectotexnote|, |\versotextnote|, |\rectoemendation|, |\versoemendation|,
% |\rectoexplanatory|, |\versoexplanatory| and their prose equivalents |\rectoprosetextnote|
% and so on) you do not need to use this hack. You only need to use this hack if 
% you are defining your own endnote sections using |\definenewnotetype|. 
% 
% \subsection{~Crop marks}
% \textsf{poemscol} no longer provides cropmarks, but is compatible with 
% the style packages that do. I use \textsf{crop}, with the 
% letter,pdftex,cam, and center options.
%
%
% \subsection{~Incompatibility with \textsf{memoir} and \textsf{verse}}
% Unfortunately, \textsf{poemscol} is not compatible with the
% \textsf{memoir} class and the \textsf{verse} package, because they
% share some command names. I am preparing a workaround for this 
% problem. 
%
% \subsection{~Conflict with \textsf{BibLaTeX} }
% \BibTeX\ works with \textsf{poemscol} with no problem. But a bug I haven't
% yet tracked down  (probably involving |\makeatletter|)
% complicates the use of \textsf{BibLaTeX}. To use \textsf{BibLaTeX}
% you will need to open up the .bbl file. You will find near the top
% the following lines:\\
%  |\makeatletter|\\
%  |\@ifundefined{ver@biblatex.sty}|\\
%  | {\@latex@error|\\
%     |{Missing 'biblatex' package}|\\
%    | {The bibliography requires the 'biblatex' package.}|\\

% \subsection{~Compatibility with earlier versions of
% \textsf{poemscol}} Making \textsf{poemscol} compatible with
% \textsf{lineno} required me also to change the commands for turning
% verse line numbering on and off, which means that version 2.3 of
% \textsf{poemscol} is incompatible with prior versions.  The old
% command |\makelinenumbers| has been replaced with
% |\makeverselinenumbers| to distinguish it from a command from the
% \textsf{lineno} world.  (|\makelinenumbers| will still work, but I
% have deprecated it.)  To turn on verse line numbering, issue
% |\makeverselinenumbers|.  Because the counter ``linenumber'' has
% been changed to ``verselinenumber,'' you must use
% |\global\verselinenumbersfalse| to turn off line numbering, rather
% than |\global\linenumbersfalse| as before.  
% 
% Up to version 2.44 \textsf{poemscol} borrowed the code for
% |\sidepar| non-floating marginal paragraphs from the memoir class, 
% and also made |\leftsidepar| and |\rightsidepar| commands on their 
% model. Version 2.46 modified Peter Wilson's original code for 
% |\sidepar|, so therefore I have changed the names of |\sidepar|, 
% |\leftsidepar|, and |\rightsidepar| to |\pmclsidepar|, 
% |\pmclleftsidepar| and |\pmclrightsidepar| respectively. If you 
% used any of these commands in your files, you will need to change 
% their names.
% 
% Up to version 2.5 the |\definenewnotetype| command took four 
% arguments, using the third argument for both the running header for 
% the notes section and for the entry in the table of contents. In 
% order to make it easier to handle titles in languages other than 
% English I have found it necessary to separate these two uses, so 
% |\definenewnotetype| now takes five arguments. You will need to 
% retrofit files that use the old version of this command. You can 
% see the details at section \ref{definingnewnotes}, page 
% \pageref{definingnewnotes}.
%
% \section{Marking up individual poems}
% First, a word about the command names. The command names may seem 
% ugly and long. And there are separate commands for many tasks that 
% seem closely related, such as a command to mark the title of a 
% section of a poetic sequence, and a separate command to mark a 
% subsection. But the names do describe pretty much what
% each macro does, and they do specify exactly what the object they 
% mark is supposed to be.  The markup is designed to look like content
% markup, marking objects as a poem title, as a stanza, as a line, and so on. 
% \textsf{poemscol} gives all of these content terms typographical
% meaning.  
% 
% There are also many commands for special purposes whose necessity
% may not seem clear until the editor finds him or herself in the jam
% the command was designed for.  For instance, \textsf{poemscol}
% normally encourages a page break before the title of a poem, or
% before the title of a section of a poetic sequence, to discourage
% page breaks between the title and the poem. But for the first
% section of a poetic sequence, or the first section of a poem in
% sections, one does not want to encourage \LaTeX\ to break the page 
% before the title, since that would leave the title of the sequence
% or the title of the larger poem as a widow on the previous page.
% |\sequencefirstsectiontitle| and its siblings are designed for this 
% situation. Although all commands like |\sequencefirstsectiontitle| 
% discourage page breaks before the title (and all of the commands
% discourage page breaks after the title), they will still sometimes 
% happen, particularly if you have a multi-line sequence title
% followed by a multi-line section title. For these cases, page
% breaks will have to be explicitly issued.
% 
% \subsection{~The title of the poem}
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\poemtitle}|\poemtitle{}|, as its name implies, sets
% the title of the poem. 
%The macro takes one
% argument --- the title, of course.  The macro typesets the title in
% the body of the volume (testing first to see whether there is enough
% space at the bottom of the page to get the title and a couple of
% lines of the poem in), typesets the title in the table of contents
% (with the page number), typesets the title in the textual notes
% (adding the page number, and checking to see whether there is room
% enough on the page), and prepares similar entries in the lists of
% emendations and in the explanatory notes (if you need them).
% \textsf{poemscol} gives default values for
% such things as the font size, the separation between the top of the
% title and the bottom of the previous poem, the separation between
% the bottom of the title and the first line, and so on.  It also sets
% penalties in order to encourage page breaks just before a title, and
% to discourage page breaks between a title and a poem. 
% 
% You can
% change all these values in your header file by changing the value of
% the parameters listed below in the implementation section using
% either |\setlength| or |\renewcommand| (depending upon what you are
% changing).  |\poemtitlefont| globally sets the font size (and
% leading) for all poem titles in the main text. 
% |\contentspoemtitlefont| globally sets the font size (and leading)
% for poem titles in the table of contents.  |\afterpoemtitleskip|
% sets the vertical separation between a poem and its title. 
% |\afterpoemskip| sets the vertical separation between the end of a
% poem and the title of the next poem.  |\poemtitlepenalty| encourages
% but does not require a page break just before a poem title.  
% If you don't want the entry in the notes section for this poem to include
% the page number of the poem, issue |\putpagenumberinnotesfalse|. A
% complete list of all of the special commands for setting font sizes,
% skips, and penalties, is in section \ref{changingfontsandleading} below.
% 

% Multiple line titles (if it matters how they are broken up on page), 
% titles of subsections of poems, titles of
% sequences of poems, and titles of the elements of a sequence of
% poems are all special cases, with special commands, which will be
% dealt with below at sections \ref{multilinetitles} and \ref{poeticsequences}. 
%You can also create new varieties of title. For instructions 
% on how to do this, see section \ref{customizing titles} below, page \pageref{customizing titles}.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\poemsubtitle} Subtitles of poems should be issued as 
% the arguments to the |\poemsubtitle{}| macro.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\titleindent} For indented parts of titles. In the 
% macros for setting the sections and subsections of poetic sequences, 
% \textsf{poemscol} uses |\titleindent| internally to set up a 
% hierarchy of indentations. (A section of a sequence is indented one 
% |\titleindent|. A subsection is indented two. And so on.) 
% |\titleindent| is also used internally in the commands for multiple 
% line titles. Instructions about changing the value of |\titleindent|
% can be found in section \ref{changingfontsandleading}.
% 
% \subsection{~The body of the poem}
% 
% \DescribeEnv{poem} The body of every poem should be placed in a
% |poem| environment.  Putting the body of the poem between
% |\begin{poem}| and |\end{poem}| resets the line counter to 1, and
% puts the poem in a |verse| environment (to handle run over lines
% automatically).  \textsf{poemscol} slightly modifies the |verse|
% environment from the standard \LaTeX\ definition, increasing the
% indentation used for run over lines, in order to make the difference
% between the indented run over portion of a long line, on one hand,
% and an explicitly indented second line, more obvious in the output.
%
% The |poem| environment takes an optional argument. If your poem has 
% short lines, and you wish to center it on the page, rather than set 
% it against the left margin of the normal |poem| environment, you can 
% give the width of the line you want to use to center the poem as the 
% argument. Alternatively, the length |\versewidth| can be used as the 
% argument. You can set the length of |\versewidth| to the proper 
% amount using |\settowidth| as follows:
% \DescribeMacro{\versewidth}
% |\settowidth{\versewidth}{Text of line to use for centering}|. To use |\versewidth|
% to center the poem on a sample line, enter the |poem| environment this way:
% |\begin{poem}[\versewidth]|.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\centertitles}
% If you center the poem on a sample 
% line, you probably also want to center the title of the poem too, 
% which you can do by issuing |\centertitles|.
% 
% \textsf{poemscol} turns off automatic hyphenation in poetry
% environments.  The idea here is that every hyphen in the printed
% poem is authorial, obviating the need for you to compile a
% hyphenated-lines list to distinguish between authorial hyphens and
% hyphens you added for lineation purposes.  Line-ending hyphens
% should not be a feature of verse anyway, I think.  (You may wish to
% change this for your own edition, in order to improve its look; but
% if you do so you must keep track of added hyphens yourself.  This
% list will be easy to compile, however, because only authorial
% hyphens will appear in your source code.  Automatically added
% hyphens will appear only in the output.  You might even modify the
% output routine so that automatically added hyphens have a different
% look.  That would be non-trivial, but Donald Knuth has an exercise
% about doing just that in \emph{The \TeX book}.)  \textsf{poemscol}
% turns automatic hyphenation back on in prose contexts, so if you
% wish to keep a hyphenation list for such things as authorial
% prefaces and so on, you must do so yourself manually.
% (Alternatively, you can turn automatic hyphenation off in those
% contexts as well, by setting the |\language| to 255.  For an example
% of how to do this, look at the definition of the |\poem| environment
% in the implementation section below.  If you do turn automatic
% hyphenation off, it would be wise to restrict the change to some
% particular environment, rather than changing the |\language|
% globally.  You might wish, for instance, to turn automatic
% hyphenation off in the |\prosesection| environment.)
% 
% \DescribeEnv{stanza} Every stanza should be placed in its own stanza
% environment.  Every poem should have at least one stanza.  Marking
% the beginning and end of every stanza (with |\begin{stanza}| and
% |\end{stanza}|) provides \textsf{poemscol} with a way of detecting
% cases in which a page boundary falls on a stanza break, since in
% those cases a page turn happens when one is \emph{inside} a poem
% environment but \emph{not} inside a stanza environment.  Further,
% marking the beginning and end of every stanza makes the logical
% structure of the poem (and the editor's intentions about it) clear
% to readers of your source code.  
%
% \textsf{poemscol} adds a little bit
% more white space between stanzas than the standard \LaTeX\ |verse|
% environment does.  (I found that the standard stanza breaks did not
% leap out on the page as stanza breaks.)
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\stanzaatbottom}
% \DescribeMacro{\nostanzaatbottom}
% If you wish to change the symbol used to mark cases in which a 
% break falls on a page turn, issue the command |\stanzaatbottom{}|, 
% using as the argument whatever you wish to use to mark such cases. 
% The default is *, which is suitable for a published volume. If you 
% are preparing a typescript for submission, you may wish to set 
% |\stanzaatbottom| to ``stanza break.'' 
% 
% If you wish also to mark all cases where there is NOT a stanza break 
% at the bottom of the page, issue the command |\nostanzaatbottom{}|, 
% using as the argument whatever you wish to mark such cases. The 
% default is |\relax| (which is to say, ``don't do anything'').
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\verseline} |\verseline| should mark the end of every
% line, except the last line of every stanza (which should be marked
% with |\end{stanza}|).  |\verseline| marks the end of every line as a
% prosodic unit (since a line of verse is not simply a carriage
% return), and advances the line counter.  There are commands below
% for changing the line counter's horizontal placement (how close it
% is to the left or right margin of the line) and appearance. (See
% section \ref{marginalgeometry} for these.)
% 
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\setverselinemodulo} |\setverselinemodulo| sets how
% often a marginal line number appears.  To print a line number every
% five lines, issue |\setverselinemodulo{5}|.  The default value is
% 10.
% 
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\makeverselinenumbers}  
% Marginal verse line numbering is on by default.  To turn line
% numbering off, issue |\global\verselinenumbersfalse|.  To turn it
% back on, issue |\makeverselinenumbers|.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\verselinenumberstoright}
% \DescribeMacro{\verselinenumberstoleft}
% \DescribeMacro{\verselinenumbersswitch} 
% \DescribeMacro{\verselinenumbersgutter}
% \DescribeMacro{\verselinenumbersouter}
% To put all of the line numbers to the left, issue
% |\verselinenumberstoleft| in your preamble.
% |\verselinenumberstoright| puts the line numbers in the right
% margin.  (These two commands use non-floating marginal note macros
% derived from the \textsf{memoir} class, |\pmclleftsidepar| and
% |\pmclrightsidepar|, respectively.)  If you wish them to appear in
% the outer margins, issue |\verselinenumbersouter| in your preamble.
% If you want the line numbers to appear in the inner margins, issue
% |\verselinenumbersgutter| in your preamble.  (These two commands use
% |\pmclsidepar|, derived from |\sidepar| from the \textsf{memoir}
% class, but modified by Dan Leucking.)  You can adjust the distance
% between the marginal line number and the text with
% |\setlength{\marginparsep}{}|.The default value for |\marginparsep| 
% is 18pt, and the default value for the width of the box in which 
% the line numbers are set, |\marginparwidth|, is 10 pt.
% 
% The line numbers should print on the baseline. You can adjust them 
% to move them up or down by changing the value of a length called
% |\pmclsideparvshift|. The default value is
% |\setlength{\pmclsideparvshift}{0ex}|. 
%
% \subsection{~Special line markup}
% \DescribeMacro{\linebend} \textsf{poemscol} automatically runs over
% long lines, indenting the run over portion on the next physical
% line.  If you are unhappy with where \textsf{poemscol} has run over
% a particular line, you can ``bend'' that line by issuing |\linebend|
% at the point where you wish it to run over.  The run over portion of
% the line will be indented just as if \textsf{poemscol} had ``bent''
% the line at your selected point.  This command only works if you
% have chosen to bend the line at some point earlier than
% \textsf{poemscol} would have chosen on its own.  If you really do
% want to extend a line further into the right margin, you can
% probably do so by using a combination of |\nobreak| and |\hbox{}|,
% or by turning all of the spaces in that line into unbreakable
% spaces, marked with |~| in your source.  But \textsf{poemscol} will
% complain if you do this, and rightly so, since the result is likely
% to be ugly.
% 
% You may also wish to use |\linebend| to reproduce how your author
% broke up long lines on the page (if you know that your author cared
% about such things and did not leave them up to the typesetter).
% 
% |\linebend| should only be used for managing run over lines, not for
% cases in which a line is to be broken into separate half-lines.  For
% cases in which a line is to be broken into half-lines, use the
% |\brokenline| macro.  The two macros do similar (but not identical)
% things.  But a ``linebend'' is a feature of typesetting, and a
% ``broken line'' is a feature of versification, and it seems best to
% distinguish them logically. (|\linebend|, like |\brokenline|, issues 
% a carriage return without incrementing the line number, but 
% |\linebend| adds indentation to the next line.)
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\runoverindent} To change the indentation for the run
% over portion of verse lines globally, issue the amount of
% indentation as the argument to |\runoverindent{}|.
% |\runoverindent{}| is currently set to 6 em, rather more than the
% standard amount in the definition of the \LaTeX\ |verse|
% environment. By default, the runover portion of long lines is 
% indented. You may wish to flush the runover portion to the right 
% margin instead. For instructions about how to do this, see section 
% \ref{rightflushverse}, page \pageref{rightflushverse}.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\verseindent} The |\verseindent| command is to be
% used for formally indented lines. It should not be used to indent 
% the run over portion of long lines (which \textsf{poemscol} handles 
% automatically anyway).  |\verseindent| indents the line a bit less
% than the run over portion of long ``bent'' lines are indented, so 
% that the two cases can be visually distinguished. By default, the 
% length of |\verseindent| is 2 em. To change it, say to 3 em, issue 
% |\renewcommand{\verseindent}{\hspace{3em}}|
%  
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\brokenline}
% \DescribeMacro{\versephantom}|\brokenline| should be used where you
% wish to break the line without incrementing the line counter. 
% Authors often break a line into two half-lines, setting the
% beginning of the second half-line flush with the end of the first
% half-line.  (Sometimes these broken lines indicate a change of
% speaker.  Sometimes they just indicate a change of subject, usually
% an abrupt one, a change which calls attention to itself by
% interrupting a line rather than waiting for a line break or stanza
% break).  |\brokenline| is normally used with |\versephantom{}|,
% which adds white space exactly as long as its argument would have 
% been had it been set in type. |\versephantom{}| thus provides an easy 
% way of setting the beginning of the second half-line flush with the 
% end of the first, whatever the font size or special formatting of the 
% first line.
% 
% 
% The sestet of Yeats's sonnet ``Leda and the Swan,'' has such a broken 
% line: 
% \begin{verse}
% A shudder in the loins engenders there\\
% The broken wall, the burning roof and tower\\
% And Agamemnon dead.\\
% $\phantom{And Agamemnon dead.~}$ Being so caught up,\\
% So mastered by the brute blood of the air,\\
% Did she put on his knowledge with his power\\
% Before the indifferent beak could let her drop?\end{verse}
% 
% To set the broken line properly, issue:
% \begin{verse}
% 	And Agamemnon dead.|\brokenline|\\
% 	|\versephantom{And Agamemnon dead.}| Being so caught up,|\verseline|
% 	\end{verse}
%
% \DescribeMacro{\tweakbrokenline}
% By default, \textsf{poemscol} sets the line numbers level with the 
% ends of broken lines. If the line numbers are set to the right of 
% the text, this seems the obvious choice. Conceivably you might want 
% to set the line number level with the beginning of a broken line 
% when the line numbers are set to the left. To ensure that the line 
% numbers of broken lines are set level with the beginning of a 
% broken line when the line number is on the left, issue 
% |\tweakbrokenline| in your preamble. 
%
% You should issue |\tweakbrokenline| with caution, because although 
% it changes how |\brokenline| is handled, it does not change the 
% handling of long lines with runover. Runover lines will still set 
% the line number level with the end of the line. You can have 
% runover lines set their line number level with the beginning of the 
% line by issuing |\startverseline| at the beginning of the line.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\brokenlineatbeginning} Conceivably you might want 
% |\brokenline| to set the line number level with the beginning of 
% the line in every case. To do this, issue |\brokenlineatbeginning| 
% in your preamble. If you do this, you should be prepared to mark 
% the beginning of runover lines with |\startverseline|.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\startverseline}
% If you begin a verse line with |\startverseline| the line number 
% will be set level with the beginning of the line rather than with 
% the end. This is useful, for instance, if you want to ensure that 
% the line number of a line with runover is set level with the 
% beginning of the line. You can, if you don't want to keep track of 
% where runover lines are, start every line with |\startverseline|. 
%
% \DescribeMacro{\tweakstartverseline} 
% Rather than setting the line number of every runover line level with
% the beginning of the line, it may make more sense for you to set the
% line number level with the beginning in cases where the line number
% is to the left, and level with the end in cases where the line
% number is to the right.  You might want to do this, for instance, if
% you have decided to set all the verse lines at the outer margin (by
% issuing |\verselinenumbersouter| in your preamble), or have decided to
% set all the verse lines at the inner margin (by issuing
% |\verselinenumbersgutter| in your preamble).  To ensure that
% |\startverseline| does this, issue |\tweakstartverseline| in your
% preamble.
% 	
% \DescribeMacro{\stanzalinestraddle}
% Some poets (such as Robert Penn Warren) occasionally introduce a 
% stanza break in the middle of a broken line, considering the line to 
% be a single metrical unit despite the fact that it straddles a stanza 
% break. To record these cases, mark the end of the first half-line 
% with |\end{stanza}| as usual. But instead of opening the next stanza 
% with |\begin{stanza}| issue |\stanzalinestraddle| instead. This will 
% make sure that the line counter counts the straddling line as only one 
% line, despite the stanza break. |\stanzalinestraddle| is usually used 
% with |\versephantom{}|.
% 
% \DescribeEnv{rightflushverse}
% \DescribeMacro{\rightversebegin}\label{rightflushverse} By default,
% \textsf{poemscol} indents the runover portion of long lines by the
% amount |\runoverindent| (by default 6 em).  It is possible to set
% verse so that the runover portion is flushed to the right margin.
% To do this, you should put the |\rightflushverse| environment inside
% the |\poem| environment.  And you must mark the beginning of each
% verse line with |\rightversebegin|.  Christian Ebert has reminded me
% that the |\rightflushverse| environment must be issued \emph{inside}
% the poem environment.  Otherwise it simply flushes every line to the
% right.
%
% It is rather clumsy to need a special environment for verse with 
% right flushed runover. I plan to provide a command for switching 
% between a verse environment that indents runover lines and a verse 
% environment that flushes runover lines to the right. I have seen 
% examples of this kind of environment from Markus Kohm and Christian 
% Ebert, but so far I haven't been able to persuade them to play well with \textsf{poemscol}
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\poemlinelabel} \label{poemlinelabel}
% |\poemlinelabel{}| enables crossreferences by line number.  To make
% a line label, issue |\poemlinelabel{text of label}| right after the
% line to which you wish to refer, where ``text of label'' is some
% distinctive label you can use for a reference elsewhere.  (You
% should issue the command \emph{after} the |\verseline| or
% |\end{stanza}| command, to make sure that the line number will be
% correct.)  To produce the reference, just issue |\ref{text of label}| as usual.  
% (|\poemlinelabel| is just a crudely hacked
% version of |\label| from \LaTeX.) |\pageref{text of label}| will set
% the page number of the page on which the label appears.
% 
% \section{Making a table of contents}
% \subsection{~Setup}
% \DescribeMacro{\makepoemcontents} 
% I found the normal \LaTeX\ macros for making tables of contents
% unsuited to poetry, so I have provided my own.  To make a table of
% contents for your poems, issue |\makepoemcontents|.  It might seem
% as though you would want to issue this command in your preamble.  In
% fact it is better, for reasons explained below, to issue it
% immediately after issuing the |\putpoemcontents|, the command which
% inputs and typesets a table of contents from a prior run.
% Information for your table of contents will be written to an
% external file with the extension .ctn.  You may need to run your
% book through \LaTeX\ twice in order to generate a table of contents,
% the first time to generate the correct page numbers, and the second
% time to set the table of contents.  (Under some circumstances --- if
% you have an index, for instance --- you may need three passes rather
% than two.)  |\makepoemcontents| takes an optional argument, which
% sets the page number for the table of contents.  If your publisher
% wishes to add some front matter so that the contents will appear on
% page vii, you should issue |\makepoemcontents{7}|.

% All of the commands that generate lines in the table of contents are
% somewhat messy and somewhat rigid, but you can modify them if you
% wish.  Lines in the table of contents usually include an indent (how
% much of one depends upon what the entry is --- whether it is a
% volume title, a poem title, or something else), then the title
% itself.  If the entry is for a poem, for a section of a poem, or for
% a section of a poetic sequence, a slash follows the title, followed
% by the page number.  If you wish to give \emph{all} your entries a
% different look altogether, modify the |\c@ntentsinfo| macro below
% (see section \ref{poemtitlecode}, page \pageref{poemtitlecode}).  To
% change the appearance of a \emph{particular} kind of entry (for all
% sequences of poems, for instance), go to the definition of the title
% of that kind of entry (e.g. |\sequencetitle|) below, find the line
% where it calls the |\c@ntentsinfo| macro, and change the arguments
% to that macro to suit you.
%
%\DescribeMacro{\setcontentsleaders} By default the title and the page 
% are separated by a slash (actually by |~/~|). If you wish to change 
% this, say to put dot leaders in instead, issue what you wish to use 
% as the argument to |\setcontentsleaders|, as for instance 
% |\setcontentsleaders{\poemdotfill}|, which will flush the number to 
% the right margin, and insert leading dots up to the number.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\putpoemcontents}\label{putpoemcontents} 
% |\putpoemcontents| will input the table of contents file if it
% exists, and complain on your log file if it does not.  Because the
% table of contents uses a special page style and special fonts
% |\putpoemcontents| restores the default fancy page style once it has
% input the contents, and restores |\normalfont| as well.  Be sure to
% reset the style of page numbering (from |\pagenumbering{roman}| to
% |\pagenumbering{arabic}|) after issuing |\putpoemcontents|, since
% when you read in the external file created by |\makepoemcontents|
% the page numbering will be set to roman.  The command
% |\resetpagestyle| (which is called by |\putpoemcontents|) will reset
% the fancy page style to that used in the main body of the volume,
% but it won't change the page numbering to arabic, in case there is
% some frontmatter between the contents and the main text, so you
% should be sure to do so yourself.  If you neglect to issue
% |\pagenumbering{arabic}| before you begin to get to your poems your
% page numbering will remain in roman numerals.  The notes sections
% use the page numbers from the poem to construct running headers of
% the form ``Notes to pp.~xx--yy.''  If those numbers are roman
% numerals rather than arabic ones, \textsf{poemscol} will not
% recognize them as numbers, and you will get the infamous ``Missing
% Number'' error that puzzles so many users of \LaTeX.
% 
% Because |\putpoemcontents| uses the table of contents file from a
% prior run, you should issue |\putpoemcontents| \emph{before} issuing
% |\makepoemcontents|.  That sounds counterintuitive.  But remember
% that |\putpoemcontents| will read in the contents file you made on a
% previous run, and |\makepoemcontents| will over-write that file and
% start a new one.  You should issue |\makepoemcontents| just
% \emph{after} issuing |\putpoemcontents|.
% 
% \subsection{~Contents entries for notes sections and the index}
%
% \begin{sloppypar}\DescribeMacro{\puttextnotes}
% \DescribeMacro{\putemendations}
% \DescribeMacro{\putexplanatory} 
% |\puttextnotes|, and its siblings |\putemendations| and
% |\putexplanatory|, linput the formatted notes
% sections, and put entries for them into your table of contents.  
% You will have to run \LaTeX\ again to set the
% table of contents properly.  The first run sets a label to find the
% page number to add to the table of contents, and the second run
% actually sets the table of contents.  (These commands are described
% below, in section \ref{putexternalfiles}.)  All of these commands
% also restore normal hyphenation.  \end{sloppypar}
%
% \DescribeMacro{\putpoemindex}
% |\putpoemindex| inputs the formatted index, and adds an entry 
% for it into the table of contents.
% Remember that if you are making an index of titles and first lines
% you may need to run your file through \LaTeX\ after running
% MakeIndex, to put the entry for the index into your table of
% contents.  
%
% \DescribeMacro{\putmultiplepoemindex}
%Use |\putmultiplepoemindex| instead if 
% you are making several indices. For instructions about 
% |\putmultiplepoemindex| see section \ref{multipleindex}, 
% p.~\pageref{multipleindex}.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\finish} Rather than issuing |\putpoemcontents| in
% the proper place, and |\puttextnotes| and its siblings in their
% proper places, you can issue the |\finish| command just after your
% last poem.  |\finish| turns automatic hyphenation back on, closes
% and reads back in the external files for the emendations, the
% textual collations, and the explanatory notes, sets the index of
% first lines and titles, puts the information about these sections in
% the table of contents, closes the external file for the contents,
% and reads it back in.  One disadvantage of this method is that
% you print the book with the contents at the end, so when you print
% it you must retrieve the contents pages and put them in the proper
% place.  I found the convenience worth the hassle, but you might not.
% This command is deprecated now. But I have retained it, since the 
% few users who gave me their opinions of the matter told me that 
% they preferred to use |\finish| than |\puttextnotes|.

% 
% \section{Making an index of titles and first lines}
% \subsection{~Setup}
% \DescribeMacro{\indexingontrue} To set up the Index section of your
% volume, issue |\indexingontrue| in your preamble.  This will create
% the external file for your index information and send that file the
% typesetting information for its title.  You must process this
% external file (the .idx file) with MakeIndex and run your book
% through \LaTeX\ again in order to set a properly organized and
% formatted index.  MakeIndex sorts the various multi-level ``index
% cards'' generated by all of the |\index| commands in your source
% files.  Once you have processed your .idx file with MakeIndex, and
% generated the sorted and formatted .ind file for your book, the
% |\putpoemindex| command will insert the typeset index where you
% issue it, and put an entry for your index in your table of contents.
% You will have to run your file through \LaTeX\ again to make the
% page number for that entry correct.
% 
% \textsf{poemscol} sets up a two-column index with a simple running
% header.  (Setting up a two-column index, however, requires that you
% include the \textsf{multicol} package in your |\usepackage{}| list.)
% To turn indexing off, issue |\global\indexingonfalse|.  
% 
% Enter the individual index entries in the poems as you normally
% would for use by MakeIndex (say, after each title and first line).  One of
% the nice features of MakeIndex is that every entry has two parts,
% one for specifying the sort key of the entry (or subentry), the other
% for specifying the font and typesetting information of the entry (or
% subentry).  This enables you to drop all of the initial uses of
% ``the'' in titles for sorting purposes, while still including the
% ``the'' in the title.  It also enables you to distinguish titles
% from first lines (by italicizing them), and to include typesetting
% information (such as italicization) in titles or first lines without
% messing up their sort order. 
% 
% \subsection{~Making Multiple Indices}\label{multipleindex}
% \textsf{poemscol} can work with \textsf{splitindex} to generate 
% more than one index. You might, for instance, wish a separate index 
% of titles and index of first lines, or an index of proper names. To 
% do this, call \textsf{splitindex} in your list of packages. Then, 
% in your preamble, declare the indices you are planning to use, e.g.
% |\newindex[Index of Titles]{idx}|
% |\newindex[Index of First Lines]{fir}| 
% |\newindex[Onomastic Index]{ono}|. The second argument is the 
% ``shortcut'' defined by \textsf{splitindex}, and will be used to 
% mark index entries in your text (see below), and as the extension 
% for the external index files used by MakeIndex.
% 
% Then mark up individual entries. Some entries (in the example 
% above, the ``Index of Titles'' examples) can be marked up with 
% |\index| just as if you were using only one index. Entries for 
% other indices should be marked using the |\sindex| command from 
% \textsf{splitindex}, as follows
% \begin{verbatim} 
% \sindex[fir]{Of Man's first disobedience and the fruit} 
% \end{verbatim}
% where the 
% first argument is the ``shortcut'' and the second is the index 
% entry. If you are loading \textsf{splitindex} with the 
% \textsf{split} option, the different types of index entry will be 
% sent to separate output streams, which each must be processed separately 
% with MakeIndex. \TeX\ has only a limited number of such output 
% streams, however, so it is probably wiser not to choose that 
% option, but to use splitindex.tex, splitindex.pl, or one of the 
% other means provided with the \textsf{splitindex} package to break 
% up the index into the separate parts, each of which must be 
% processed with MakeIndex separately.
% 
% To include the indices, and to add entries for them to the table of 
% contents, issue |\putmultiplepoemindex| for each one. 
% |\putmultiplepoemindex| takes four arguments, which are: 1. The 
% three letter ``shortcut'' used by |\splitindex|, 2. The title of 
% the Index on its first page, 3. The running header for that index 
% section, and 4. The name of the section as you wish it to appear in 
% the Table of Contents. So, for instance
% \begin{verbatim}
% \putmultiplepoemindex{fir}{INDEX OF FIRST LINES}{Index of First 
% Lines}{First Line Index} \end{verbatim}
% includes an index with shortcut ``fir,'' title ``INDEX OF FIRST 
% LINES,'' running header ``Index of First Lines,'' and contents 
% entry ``First Line Index.''
% \section{Collections with multiple volumes}
% \DescribeEnv{volumetitlepage} \DescribeEnv{maintitlepage}
% The |\volumetitlepage| environment is an
% environment for divider pages in collections made up of several
% volumes.  Volume title pages will always appear on recto pages. 
% \textsf{poemscol} will automatically create a blank verso page
% preceding the volume title page if it necessary.  The
% |\maintitlepage| environment is for the title page of the whole
% book.  The main title page will also automatically always be on a
% recto page. These divider pages have special
% page styles, with no page numbers and no running headers.
% 
% \begin{sloppypar}
% \DescribeMacro{\wholebooktitle} \DescribeMacro{\volumetitle}
% \DescribeMacro{\volumetitlefirstline}
% \DescribeMacro{\volumetitlemiddleline}
% \DescribeMacro{\volumetitlelastline} 
% \DescribeMacro{\volumesubtitle}
% \DescribeMacro{\volumesectiontitle} 
% |\wholebooktitle{}| is for the title of the entire collection.  
% |\volumetitle{}| is for the title of an individual volume within a
% Collected Poems.  The |\volumetitlefirstline{}|,
% |\volumetitlemiddleline{}|, and |\volumetitlelastline{}| macros are
% for multi-line titles of volumes gathered into the collection.  (Use
% these last commands if you want to specify how a long title is
% broken up both in the text and in the table of contents.
% \textsf{poemscol} will break up long titles on its own anyway
% if you don't specify how to break them up, but
% you might not be happy with how it breaks up the lines.)
% |\volumesubtitle{}| is for setting the subtitle to a volume.
% |\volumesectiontitle{}| is for setting the title of a section of a
% volume.  In addition to setting the text in the body of your
% edition, these commands send the title (and the formatting
% information about it) to the table of contents file and to the
% textnotes file.\end{sloppypar}
%
% \DescribeMacro{\volumeepigraph} \DescribeMacro{\volumeattribution}
% \DescribeMacro{\volumeheader} \DescribeMacro{\leftheader}
% \DescribeMacro{\rightheader} |\volumeepigraph{}| and
% |\volumeattribution{}| are for epigraphs and attributions on the
% divider pages.  |\volumeheader{}| or |\rightheader{}| is the right
% running header for that volume (except for divider pages, the table
% of contents, the notes sections, and other special cases).  Normally
% that is just the name of the particular volume.  |\leftheader{}| is
% the left running header for the entire book (except for divider
% pages, the table of contents, the notes sections, and other special
% cases).  Normally that is the name of the entire book.
% 
% \section{Recording textual notes}\label{recordingtextualnotes}
% \subsection{~Setup for sections for
% textual notes, emendations, and explanatory notes.}
% \DescribeMacro{\makeemendations} \DescribeMacro{\maketextnotes}
% \DescribeMacro{\makeexplanatorynotes} 
% To collect emendations, issue |\makeemendations| in your preamble. 
% To collect textual collations, issue |\maketextnotes| in your
% preamble.  To collect explanatory notes, issue
% |\makeexplanatorynotes| in your preamble.
% If you issue these commands,
% \textsf{poemscol} puts all of the emendations, textual collations,
% and explanatory notes in the backmatter of your volume.
% \textsf{poemscol} opens external files for emendations, textual
% collations, and explanatory notes (with extensions .emd, .ent, and
% .enx respectively), and reads them back in at the place you specify
% with |\puttextnotes|, |\putexplanatory|, or |\putemendations|, or at
% the end (if you use the |\finish| command).
%  These commands  also send to the external files the commands for typesetting the
% title of each section (e.g. Explanatory Notes) and for modifying the
% running headers of the notes sections to xx--yy format (e.g.
% ``Explanatory Notes to pp.~55--7'').
% 
% If you wish to use multi-level footnotes rather than endnotes, you 
% do not need to issue |\maketextnotes| or its relatives (but you 
% should of course issue |\textnotesatfoot| or its relatives). You can mix 
% footnotes or endnotes as you wish. You may, for instance, wish to 
% set explanatory notes as footnotes, and textual notes and 
% emendations as endnotes. Instructions for setting up 
% \textsf{poemscol} to make footnotes are in section 
% \ref{makingfootnotes} below.
% 
% In end note sections \textsf{poemscol} opens an entry (headed with
% the title and page of the poem in the text) in the textual notes
% section for every poem (since, minimally, you want to include
% information about the variants and copy text of the poem), but only
% opens entries in the emendations or explanatory notes sections if
% you actually have emendations or explanatory notes on that poem.
%
% The notes for each poem are set in a block paragraph, with a new
% paragraph for every |\poemtitle| command, and the line counter for
% the notes is reset to 1 with every |\begin{poem}|.  (For long poems
% in books or cantos, it would be wise to use |\poemtitle| for the
% canto names or numbers, setting the poem title in some other way,
% perhaps with |\volumetitle| described above.)
% 
% \begin{sloppypar}
% \DescribeMacro{\iftextnotessinglepar} 
% \DescribeMacro{\ifemendationssingplepar}
% \DescribeMacro{\ifexplanationssinglepar}
% You may, 
% particularly if you are annotating long poems, wish each 
% note to appear in its own paragraph rather than in a block paragraph 
% with the other notes to that poem. To do this, you need to set 
% the relevant boolean. Issue |\textnotessinglepartrue| 
% |\emendationssingplepartrue| or |\explanationssinglepartrue| to givve
% each such note a separate paragraph.
% \end{sloppypar}
%
% \DescribeMacro{\iftextnotestwocol} 
% \DescribeMacro{\ifemendationstwocol}
% \DescribeMacro{\ifexplanationstwocol}
% By default, notes are set in single columns. To set them in two column mode, 
% set the relevant booleans to true, e.g. |\textnotestwocoltrue|.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\putpagenumberinnotesfalse}
% \DescribeMacro{\puttitleinnotesfalse}
% You may not wish to have the poem's page number and title appear in
% the notes.  To turn off the appearance of the page number in the
% notes, issue |\putpagenumberinnotesfalse|.  You may also not wish to
% put the poem's title in the notes.  To turn off the appearance of the
% poem's title in the notes, issue |\puttitleinnotesfalse|.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\contentsendnotesindent}
% \DescribeMacro{\contentsendnotesfont}
% You can control the appearance of the entry for endnote sections in 
% the table of contents by changing the definition of 
% |\contentsendnotesindent| (set by default to |\contentsindentone|) 
% or |\contentsendnotesfont| (set by default to 
% |\contentspoemtitlefont|.
%
% \subsection{~Textual notes of various kinds}
% \DescribeMacro{\sources} To record information about the copy text,
% editions and publication history of individual poems, or any
% information not tied to specific lines in the poem, you should place
% that information in the argument to the |\sources{}| macro.
% Typically, you should issue this macro after you have issued
% |\poemtitle{}| and before you issue |\begin{poem}|.  If you wish to
% send information to the textual notes file (such as to force a page
% break), you can do so by using |\sources{}|.  You can send
% typesetting information to other sections by using
% |\literalemend{}|, |\literalexplain{}|, or |\literalcontents{}|.
% There is also a |\literaltextnote{}| command, which is equivalent to
% |\sources{}|.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\textnote}
% \DescribeMacro{\emendation}
% \DescribeMacro{\explanatory}
% |\textnote{}| is used to capture variants and tie them to the
% correct line number.  You don't have to count line numbers. 
% \textsf{poemscol} keeps track of them for you.  Issue |\textnote{}|
% immediately after the |\verseline| command which marks the ending of
% the line you wish to comment upon.  Put the text of your note (which
% may be simply the recording of a variant in standard notation) into
% the argument of the macro.  You should put both the lemma and the
% variants or comment in the argument to the |\textnote{}| macro. 
% For emendations, use |\emendation{}|, and for explanatory notes,
% use |\explanatory{}|. These notes go to their own endnote sections. The
% only difference is that each poem opens a new paragraph for its own 
% textual notes, but paragraphs for explanatory notes or emendations are only 
% opened if there actually are explanatory notes or emendations for that poem.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\sameword}
% \DescribeMacro{\missingpunct}
%  To
% put the $\sim$ glyph in your note (used for recording places where
% the variant and the copy text have the same word, as for instance
% when recording a variation of punctuation) use |\sameword|.  To put
% the ${}_{\wedge}$ glyph into your text (used for recording places
% where a punctuation mark is missing in a variant), use
% |\missingpunct|. 
%
% For notes that refer to ranges of lines, |\textnote|, |\emendation|,
% and |\explanatory| have an optional argument, which records how many
% lines the note refers to.  There are two ways of using this
% argument.  The grubby but simple way is simply to put into the
% argument the number of lines it refers to.  If, for instance, you
% issue |\textnote[4]{lemma] rest of note}|, \textsf{poemscol}, rather
% than printing merely the number of the line which closed just before
% you issued |\textnote|, will print a line range, beginning at that
% line, and ending at the fourth line after it.  If that |\textnote|
% were issued after line 214, this is to say, the output in the
% textual notes would be: 214--218: lemma] rest of note.
% 
% \begin{sloppypar} It seems clumsy to count the lines referred to by
% a note, especially since you don't have to count lines to set where
% the note begins.  A more sophisticated way, and one which involves
% no counting, is to make a unique poem line label for the last line
% of the range by issuing |\poemlinelabel{some unique label}| just
% after the |\verseline| or |\end{stanza}| that ends the range.  (To
% use |\poemlinelabel| see section \ref{poemlinelabel}.)  Then, back
% after the |\verseline| or |\end{stanza}| command that closes the
% first line of the range, put the text of the label into the optional
% argument of |\textnote| as follows: |\textnote[some unique label]{lemma]rest of note}|.  
%This is the preferred method.  The
% line-counting method is deprecated, but retained for backwards
% compatibility with earlier versions.  If you use the label method,
% you will have to run your file through \LaTeX\ twice, once to define
% the labels, and once to set the text.\end{sloppypar}
%
% Here is a complete example:
%\begin{verbatim}
%Yes, then I met the beast. Well, better, indeed,\verseline
%\textnote[had it been the]{better, indeed, / Had it been the] better if 
%it / Had been the 1953TS (revised in black pencil 
%on 1953TS to 1953)}
%Had it been the manifest beast and the circumstantial\verseline
%\poemlinelabel{had it been the}
%Avatar of destruction. But no beast then: the towering\verseline
%Definition, angelic, arrogant, abstract,\verseline
%Greaved in glory, thewed with light, the bright\verseline
%Brow tall as dawn. I could not see the eyes.\end{stanza}
% \end{verbatim}
% 
% Overlapping lemmas, or lemmas that 
% include stanza breaks, do not pose any difficulties for |poemscol|. 
% 
% |\emendation{}| and |\explanatory{}| are used exactly as |\textnote{}| 
% is. Issue the emendation or the explanatory note as the argument to 
% the command. Place the command immediately after the |\verseline| that 
% concludes the line to which it is a comment. These commands also can 
% take optional arguments to specify line ranges.
% 
% If you quote verse \emph{within} a textual note, an explanatory
% note, or an emendation, you may want to use the normal \LaTeX\
% markup for verse for that quotation, rather than the special markup
% for \textsf{poemscol}.  \textsf{poemscol} will not complain about
% this.
% 
% If a textual note \emph{ends} with a quotation in verse, you should
% follow the |\textnote{}| entry with
% |\quotedversecorrectiontextnote|.  I found that if I quoted verse in
% the note sections a dirty trick I used to send the notes to the
% external files would cause the following notes on that poem in the
% notes sections to be set in a new paragraph.  (This is of course not
% a problem if the quoted verse is the last thing in the notes to that
% poem, since the next poem will open a new paragraph in the notes
% anyway.  It is also not a problem if more of the individual textnote
% follows the verse.  It's only a problem if the last thing in the
% note is quoted verse, and the note is not the last one on that
% poem.)  The command should set it flush as it is, but I have found
% odd cases I can't understand in which that doesn't work, so the
% command has an optional argument, which should be the additional
% length you need to adjust the next line by to make it flush.  The
% default is 0pt.  |\quotedversecorrectionexplanatory| and
% |\quotedversecorrectionemendation| should follow explanatory notes
% or emendations that end with snippets of verse.  These three
% commands are an embarrassing kludge on my part.  They simply send
% commands to the relevant note sections that prohibit opening a new
% paragraph.  You should issue this command in the main text right
% after the close of the textnote (not in the text of the textnote
% itself).
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\accidental} |\accidental{}| behaves exactly like 
% |\textnote{}|. If you wish to distinguish between accidentals and 
% substantives, this command provides a way of doing so. If you wish to 
% exclude 
% accidentals from your textual notes, issue 
% |\global||\includeaccidentalsfalse| in your preamble. Accidentals 
% are included by default, but if you issue |\includeaccidentalstrue| 
% in your preamble, you will remind yourself of that fact. 
% 
% \textsf{poemscol} does not provide for a separate backmatter section
% for accidentals, but it would be trivial to construct one, using 
% |\definenewnotetype|, described in section \ref{definingnewnotes} 
% below.  Use |\definenewnotetype| to create a command called 
% |\newaccidental|, then issue| \let\accidental=\newaccidental|.
% 
% If you wish to exclude accidentals from your printed output, but to
% mark them in your source files, so that your published collation
% consists only of substantives, issue
% |\global\includeaccidentalsfalse| in your preamble.  Many publishers
% are reluctant to publish accidentals, believing that they are, well,
% less substantive than substantives.  Using the |\accidental{}|
% command allows you to exclude accidentals from the published version
% should your publisher insist, while preserving the information about
% them should the publisher's mind change.  In the very worst case, if
% you have marked all the accidentals in this way you can still
% produce a list of accidentals for later use, and other scholars can
% search for accidentals in your source files simply by searching for
% the string |\accidental|.
% 
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\tsvariant} \DescribeMacro{\tsentry} Some publishers
% may turn up their noses at typescript or manuscript variants in just
% the way they turn up their noses at accidentals.  If you wish to
% distinguish between published variants and typescript,
% man\-u\-script, or galley variants, |\tsvariant| (for a whole note)
% and |\tsentry| (for a typescript entry in a list of variants in a
% textual note that includes other kinds of variant) provide ways of
% doing so.  By default, typescript variants are included.  To exclude
% typescript variants, issue |\global\includetypescriptsfalse| in your
% preamble.  You can issue |\global||\includetypescriptstrue| in your
% preamble, to remind yourself that you are including typescript
% variants.  In that (default) case |\tsvariant{}| will behave exactly
% like |\textnote{}|, and entries in other notes marked with
% |\tsentry| will be included in your output.
% 
% Here is how to use |\tsentry|:
% if you wish to include typescript entries in a single note including
% those entries in a list with variants from other published versions
% (as for instance when a comma appears in a typescript but only in
% the second edition of the published poem), simply issue
% |\textnote{}| as usual, marking the relevant variant in the list of
% variants with the |\tsentry{}| macro. If typescript variants
% are excluded, the typescript entry will also be excluded. 
%
% Here is a typical use of the |\tsentry{}| command:
% \begin{verbatim}
% Of moonlit desert. A stallion, white and flashing, slips,\verseline
% \textnote{Of moonlit] Of the moonlit {\em NY\/}\tsentry{, SP85TS 
% (revised in black pen to SP85)}}
% \end{verbatim}
%  
% Notice that since the |\tsentry{}| comes in the middle of the list, 
% it begins with a comma. You might expect an |\unskip| command 
% before the comma, to prevent 
% \LaTeX\ from adding white space before the comma. \textsf{poemscol} 
% automatically provides the |\unskip| if the entry starts with a 
% comma or a semicolon.
%
% You can
% mark individual variants with |\tsentry{}| in the arguments to the
% |\explanatory{}| and |\emendation{}| commands as well, and 
% |\tsentry| will also behave normally in any endnote or footnote section 
% you define using |\definenewnotetype|.
% 
% \textsf{poemscol} does not provide for a separate backmatter section
% for typescript variants, but it would be trivial to construct one,
% again using |\definenewnotetype|. To do this, you would also have to 
% copy all of the emendations, explanatory notes, and textual notes 
% which have a |\tsentry| in their arguments, and add
% |\tsvariant{}| commands in those places. For information about 
% |\definenewnotetype| see section \ref{definingnewnotes}.
%
% \section{Creating new kinds of endnote} \label{definingnewnotes}
% \DescribeMacro{\definenewnotetype} The |\definenewnotetype| macro
% can be used to create new kinds of endnote, in case the kinds
% \textsf{poemscol} defined are not enough.  |\definenewnotetype|
% takes five arguments.  They are \begin{enumerate} \item A base name
% used to construct \begin{itemize} \item some |\if| variables (e.g.
% |\ifmynoteson| to see whether you are collecting ``mynotes'',
% |\ifnomynoteyet| to see whether you have written a ``mynote'' for a
% particular poem yet, |\ifmynotestwocol| to set the notes in two
% column mode, and |\ifmynotesinglepar| to set the notes in
% one paragraph per note form, rather than in block paragraphs).  
% \textsf{poemscol} will only open an entry for a poem in the
% ``mynotes'' section if there actually is a ``mynote'' on that poem.
% Note that every  |\if| that refers to a section is plural
% (|\ifmynoteson|, |\ifmynotestwocol|, |\ifmynotessinglepar|) and 
% that every |\if| that refers to a singular note
% is singular (|\ifnomynoteyet|).  \item The name for the output
% channel for writing the notes to the appropriate external file.
% This name will always be plural.  \item The name for the ``literal''
% command for writing literal, unexpanded text on the file (as
% |\literaltextnote{}| does on the textnotes file), and for the note
% command that sends the actual textual note (line number and all) to
% the section (e.g. |\mynote{}|), also the command to write notes in
% line-numbered prose (e.g. |\prosemynote{}{}|) or prose numbered by
% paragraph and sentence (e.g. |\pmmynote{}|).  These commands will
% always be singular.  \item The name of the |\put| command (e.g.
% |\putmynotes|) which closes the external file for the notes section,
% reads it back in to your document, and adds an entry in the table of
% contents for that notes section.  This command will always be
% plural.  \item The name of the |\margref| command for putting a
% marginal mark next to a line giving the page number in the apparatus
% where a note is to be found (e.g. |\margrefmynote|) \end{itemize}
% \item The extension for the external file which will hold the notes
% as you generate them.  ``Emendations'' for instance, are written to
% an external file called |\jobname.emd| The file name will always be
% |\jobname|, and the different species of endnotes will all have
% distinctive extensions.  (|\jobname| is a macro that always expands
% to the name of your top level source file.  If, for instance, I am
% setting running a file called ``myfile.tex'' through \LaTeX\,
% |\jobname.emd| translates to ``myfile.emd.'') \item The title of the
% notes section as you wish it to appear in the running header (e.g.
% ``Emendations'').  \item The title of the notes section as you wish
% it to appear on the first page of the notes section (e.g.
% ``EMENDATIONS'').  \item The title of the notes section as you wish
% it to appear in the table of contents.  \end{enumerate}
% 
% \sloppypar So, for instance,\begin{verbatim} 
% \definenewnotetype{xyznote}{xyz}{Xyznotes to}{XYZNOTES}{Xyznotes} 
% \end{verbatim}
% creates the booleans |\ifxyznoteson|,  |\ifnoxyznoteyet|, and 
% |\ifxyznotessinglepar|,  the
% commands |\xyznote|, |\literalxyznote|, |\prosexyznote|,
% |\pmxyznote|, and |\putxyznotes| (and, although you don't ever have
% to use it explicitly, |\firstxyznote|) the output channel xyznotes,
% the external file |\jobname.xyz|, an entry in the contents for
% ``Xyznotes'', and an endnotes section with a running header of the
% form ``Xyznotes to pp.~xx--yy'' and a title XYZNOTES. |\xyznote|
% takes the same arguments that |\explanatory| does (which is to say,
% an optional argument for a label for entering line ranges, and an
% argument for the lemma and the comment).  There won't be an entry
% for a poem in the ``Xyznotes'' endnotes section unless there
% actually is an xyznote for the poem.  |\prosexyznote| takes the same
% arguments |\proseexplanatory| does (which is to say, an optional
% argument for a label for entering line ranges, an argument for a
% label to capture the line number of the first line, and an argument
% for the lemma and the comment).  |\pmxyznote| behaves exactly like
% |\pmexplanatory|.
% 
% \section{Multi-level footnotes} \label{makingfootnotes}
% \textsf{poemscol} will set multiple 
% levels of footnotes in block paragraphs, separating each level with 
% a rule. To enable this feature, call the \textsf{manyfoot} package 
% as follows in your preamble: |\usepackage[ruled,para*]{manyfoot}|.
% 
% To set your textual notes as footnotes, issue |\textnotesatfoot| in
% your preamble.  If you do this, \textsf{poemscol} will actually
% create two sets of footnotes for textnotes, one for those that are
% called with |\textnote|, which will produce an unindented block of
% notes, and one for those that are called with |\sources|, which will
% produce individual indented paragraphs, opening a new paragraph with
% every note.  |\sources| notes often have several paragraphs, so they
% are inappropriate for block-paragraph or ``para'' mode, and because
% those paragraphs are often in fact prose paragraphs, rather than
% blocks of notations, they are indented, so that they will be read as
% prose.  To set your emendations as footnotes, issue
% |\emendationsatfoot| in your preamble.  These notes will be set by
% default as block paragraphs.  If you have multiple-paragraph notes
% in your emendations, you should redefine these notes to set plain
% rather than para style notes. (See the next paragraph for how to do 
% this.) To set your explanatory notes as
% footnotes, issue |\explanationsatfoot|.  These notes will also, by
% default, be plain style notes, with one indented paragraph per note.
% You do not need to issue |\maketextnotes|, |\makeemendations| or
% |\makeexplanatorynotes| if you set those notes as footnotes.  If you
% use |\literaltextnote| anywhere in your file, however, you will lose
% the text it would have put in your textnotes, since |\literaltext|
% just writes its argument onto the external file for textual notes.
% 
% 
% To change the style of your footnotes between plain and
% para modes, globally change the values some of the following
% booleans.  |\ifsourcesfootnotespara|, obviously, is true if
% footnotes from the |\sources| command are set in ``para'' mode
% (default is false).  |\iftextfootnotespara| is true if footnotes
% from |\textnote| are set in ``para'' mode (default is true).
% |\ifemendationfootnotespara|, or |\ifexplanfootnotespara| are the
% booleans which set the style of footnotes from |\emendation| and
% |\explanatory| respectively.  By default, footnotes from
% |\emendation| are set in ``para'' mode, and footnotes from
% |\explanatory| are set in ``plain'' mode.  g explanatory
% footnotes from plain to para mode, for instance, issue
% |\global\explanfootnotesparatrue|.  Counterintuitive as it sounds,
% you must issue this \emph{before} issuing |\textnotesatfoot| (or the
% command for whichever other kind of note you are wishing to change
% the appearance of).
% 
% When |\sources| is defined to send endnotes to the textual notes 
% section, they usually appear immediately underneath the title of 
% the volume or poem they comment upon. If you are having |\sources| 
% output footnotes, it would be a good idea to open the note with the 
% title of the volume or poem it is a comment upon, in case there is 
% more than one poem on the page.
% 
% When note classes are set as footnotes, the symbol which marks 
% cases in which a page turn falls on a stanza break will be set 
% \emph{beneath} the footnotes. This is a consequence of the way 
% \textsf{poemscol} uses the |\mark| mechanism to keep track of these 
% cases, so I have not figured out how to change it. But it may well 
% be more of an idiosyncrasy than a bug, particularly if the symbol 
% is changed from * to something like ``stanza break at page turn.''
%  
% To create a new level of footnote, you must first declare it to 
% make it known to \textsf{manyfoot}, which requires each level of 
% footnote to be given a unique suffix (usually a capital letter of 
% the alphabet). You can declare a new footnote level called 
% |\footnoteE{}| for instance, by issuing 
% |\DeclareNewFootnote[para]{E}|. You will want notes which don't put 
% a mark in the body of the text, and begin with the line number or 
% range of line numbers of the lemma. To define a footnote called 
% |\mynote{}|, first declare new footnote |\footnoteE| (A, B, C and D 
% are reserved for sources, textual notes, emendations, and explanatory notes, 
% respectively). Then issue
%  |\newcommand{\mynote}[2][0]{\setlemmarange{#1}|\\
% |\FootnotetextE{\citerange}{#2}|
% | \resetlemmacounters}| (|\setlemmarange|, |\citerange|, and 
% |\resetlemmacounters| enable your footnote to handle line ranges in 
% the lemma.) If a |\mynote| refers to a range of lines, you can issue 
% the same kinds of optional argument that are used with |\textnote|.
% 
% \section{Pulling it all together} 
% \DescribeMacro{\testforauxonfirstrun} If you don't want to listen to
% \LaTeX\ complain about missing references during your first run,
% issue |\testforauxonfirstrun|, which won't let |\finish|,
% |\putexplanatory|, |\puttextnotes|, or |\putemendations| run unless
% there is an .aux file for a previous run.  \emph{Be sure to issue
% this command before issuing} |\begin{document}|, \emph{since that
% reads in the existing .aux file, and overwrites it with a new one.}
% 
% \label{putexternalfiles}
% \DescribeMacro{\putemendations} This macro closes the external file
% for emendations and reads it in.  It also puts an entry for the
% emendations section into your table of contents.  After
% |\putemendations| has read in the external file for emendations, you
% will need to run your file through \LaTeX\ again, to put the correct
% page number in the table of contents file.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\puttextnotes}
% \DescribeMacro{\putexplanatory} |\puttextnotes| and 
% |\putexplanatory| do the same thing for the textual 
% notes and for the explanatory notes.
% 
% All of these last three commands restore normal hyphenation. Since 
% all three are printed with the |\small| font size, the hyphen 
% character is defined only for that size. This should not create 
% other issues, however, because the commands that prohibit 
% hyphenation in the |poem| environment (and in the |contentsentry| 
% environment) are local to those environments, so the restoration of 
% the hyphen character may be redundant.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\putpoemindex} |\putpoemindex| reads in the index at
% this point, and adds an entry for the index to external file for the
% table of contents.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\putmultiplepoemindex} If you are generating 
% several indices using \textsf{splitindex} |\putmultiplepoemindex| 
% reads in one of them at this point. For instructions about this 
% command, see section \ref{multipleindex}, p.~\pageref{multipleindex}.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\finish} The
% |\finish| macro is deprecated but still available.  It is designed
% to be placed just before |\end{document}| (which, in fact, it
% replaces --- but you should still put an |\end{document}| at the end
% of your document for form's sake).  |\finish| closes the external
% files for the three notes sections and reads them back into the
% document (turning the automatic hyphenation back on for these
% sections).  It adds entries to the table of contents file for the
% notes sections.  It reads in the formatted index file (which you
% have made from your raw .idx file using MakeIndex between \LaTeX\
% runs) and adds an entry for the index to the table of contents.
% Then it closes the external file for the table of contents and reads
% that in (putting it at the end of the document, as I explained
% before).  Then it adds a page explaining that the symbol (by default
% *) at the bottom of certain pages marks places where a stanza break
% and a page break coincide.  If you have an editor's introduction
% preceding your notes section, or a list of abbreviations, you may
% wish to consult the |\finish| macro for suggestions about how to add
% the lines to read those files in and add entries for them in the
% table of contents.
%
% 
% \section{Special cases}
% \subsection{~Epigraphs, attributions etc.}
% \DescribeMacro{\epigraph} \DescribeMacro{\headnote}
% \DescribeMacro{\attribution} \DescribeMacro{\poemdedication} 
% |\epigraph|, |\headnote|, |\attribution|, and |\poemdedication| set
% their arguments as epigraphs, headnotes, attributions, or
% dedications.  If you have dedications, epigraphs, or attributions on
% the divider pages of editions that combine several volumes of
% poetry, use |\volumededication{}|, |\volumeepigraph{}|, and
% |\volumeattribution{}|. You can adjust the left and right margins 
% of epigraphs by changing the values of |\epigraphquoteleftmargin| 
% or |\epigraphquoterightmargin|
% 
% \subsection{~Inset prose quotations}
% \DescribeMacro{\saveverselinenumber}
% \DescribeMacro{\restoreverselinenumber} Sometimes you will have inset prose 
% passages, but you will not wish to start the line numbering over 
% after the passage. The way to set this is to issue |\end{stanza}| 
% at the end of the stanza before the prose insert. Then issue 
% |\saveverselinenumber|. Then issue |\end{poem}|. Insert the prose 
% quotation (perhaps followed by |\attribution{}|). Then issue 
% |\begin{poem}| followed by |\restoreverselinenumber| and |\begin{stanza}|. 
% Then begin entering the rest of the poem as usual. Longer, independent prose 
% sections (such as the author's preface or prose poems) require 
% different handling. To provide line numbers and notes for such 
% prose sections, see section \ref{prosesections}.
% 
% \subsection{~Multiline poem titles}\label{multilinetitles}
% \DescribeMacro{\poemtitlefirstline}
% \DescribeMacro{\poemtitlemiddleline}
% \DescribeMacro{\poemtitlelastline}
% \DescribeMacro{\poemtitlenocontents}
% \DescribeMacro{\poemtitlebaretitle}
%  Very long titles present special problems.  In the first place, they
% require special provisions to make sure that page breaks don't
% happen in the middle of a title, or immediately after a title.  In
% the second place, they raise questions about how the author wished
% to break them up over several lines.  If you think it might matter,
% these macros make it possible for you to ensure that long titles are
% broken in exactly the same way in your text and in your table of
% contents.  (I didn't pursue this question for titles in notes
% sections, and in notes sections these commands simply concatenate a
% long title.) 
% 
% If you wish to set the titles differently in the text and in the
% contents, you can set the title in the text and notes with
% |\poemtitlenocontents{}| and send a differently formatted entry to
% the table of contents file using |\literalcontents{}|. (Remember 
% that you will have to send not only the title of the poem to the 
% contents, but also the other formatting information, such as the 
% indentation, the slash, and the label for the page number.)
% |\poemtitlebaretitle{}| simply sets the title in the text, enabling
% you to use |\literalcontents{}| and |literaltextnotes{}| to produce
% whatever effect you wish.
% 
% Alternatively, you can just let \textsf{poemscol} handle the long 
% titles by itself. If you are pretty sure that the author did not 
% care how long titles were broken up, this would probably be the 
% best thing to do. Remember also that if \textsf{poemscol} breaks a 
% title across two lines, you can always force it not break the line 
% by using enclosing the argument to |\poemtitle{}| in |\hbox{}|. You 
% may get a complaint on your log file about an overfull |\hbox| if 
% you do this, however.
%
% \subsection{~Italicized poem titles and empty poem titles} Titles
% with italics or other special formatting posed special problems in
% earlier versions (before version 1.7) since the typesetting commands
% gummed up how I passed parameters around that I was unable to solve
% using |\protect|.  All of these commands are obsolete now, but are
% retained for backward compatibility.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\poemtitleitalic{}{}} |\poemtitleitalic{}{}| takes
% two arguments.  The first is the title of the poem with the italics
% (or small capitals or international characters or what have you),
% for typesetting, and the second is the title without the commands,
% for cross reference purposes.  (Actually, now that \textsf{poemscol}
% no longer needs to treat italics in titles in a different way, it can
% be anything you want, since the second argument is discarded.)
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\poemtitlenotitle{}}
% |\poemtitlenotitle{}|, with its paradoxical name, is for poems 
% without formal titles. Usually such poems are referred to by their 
% first lines. This macro does not produce a title in the text, but 
% sets its argument in the table of contents and in the notes. Usually 
% you use the first line as the moral equivalent of a title.
% 
%  \DescribeMacro{\poemtitlenotitleitalic{}{}}
%  |\poemtitlenotitleitalic{}{}|, with its even more paradoxical name, 
% is for poems without formal titles but with italicized words in their 
% first lines.  |\poemtitlenotitleitalic{}{}| takes two arguments. The 
% first is the first line with the italics (for typesetting 
% purposes), and the second is the 
% first line without the italics (for crossreference purposes). This command
% is obsolete now that italics in titles no longer require special 
% handing, but is retained for backwards compatibility.
% 
% \subsection{~Poems in sections}
% 
% \begin{sloppypar}
% \DescribeMacro{\poemsectiontitle} 
% |\poemsectiontitle{}| and  |\poemsubsectiontitle{}|, as their 
% names imply, are for the titles of sections or subsections of poems
% that have them.  |\poemfirstsectiontitle| is for the first section
% of a poem with many sections.  (It differs from |\poemsectiontitle|
% in that it tries to make it harder for a page break to separate the
% title of a poem from the title of its first section.)
% |\poemsectiontitlefirstline{}|, |\poemsectiontitlemiddleline|,
% |\poemsectiontitlelastline{}|, |\poemsectiontitlenocontents{}|, and
% |\poemsectiontitlebaretitle{}|), as their titles imply, are used for
% special cases such as long section titles, if you wish to specify
% explicitly how the title is to be broken up in the text and in the
% table of contents.  You can construct variants of these macros for
% dealing with special cases I didn't anticipate by using
% |\poemsectiontitlebaretitle{}| and |\literalcontents{}| and its
% siblings.\end{sloppypar}
% 
% \subsection{~Poetic sequences}\label{poeticsequences}
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\sequencetitle} \DescribeMacro{\sequencesectiontitle}
% \DescribeMacro{\sequencefirstsectiontitle} Sequences of related
% poems, perhaps with an over-title, demand special handling in the
% text, in the notes sections, and in the table of contents.  (A
% moment's thought will show that they are different in some ways from
% poems in sections.  For one thing, a sequence manifests a different
% relationship between part and whole than a poem in sections does,
% and often provides stronger experiences of momentary closure between
% sections.) |\sequencetitle{}| sets the title of the sequence, and 
% |\sequencesectiontitle{}| sets the titles of the sections of the 
% sequence. |\sequencefirstsectiontitle{}| gives a little more
% vertical space between the main title and the first section title
% than |\sequencesectiontitle{}| gives between adjacent sections later
% on in the sequence (since the over-title for the sequence is in
% larger type) and adjusts the page breaking penalties to reflect the
% fact that such titles should not occur near the bottom of a page,
% since there should be no page break between the sequence title and
% the title of the first section of the sequence (although page breaks
% are permissible, indeed even slightly favored, between later
% sections).  There should also never be a page break between a
% section title and the first or second line of the section.  The
% penalties \textsf{poemscol} sets should take care of these
% automatically, but you may still have cases which require you to
% specify a page break with |\pagebreak| or |\newpage|.  There are a
% host of other commands, all with self-explanatory titles, that deal
% with some special situations that arise in setting the elements of
% poetic sequences, such as cases where you wish to specify how long 
% titles will be broken up into lines, or where you wish no entry to 
% be made for the section in the table of contents or in the notes 
% sections.   These macros don't of course exhaust the dizzying
% possibilities, but from them you can construct whatever other macros
% you may need.

% \subsection{~Customizing titles} \label{customizing titles} \textsf{poemscol} provides a large
% number of ways of setting titles, but conceivably you may wish to
% define your own.  Here is a template for designing a new kind of
% title.  Suppose you wish to create a kind of title called
% |\mytitle{}|.  It would take one argument, which would be the title
% itself.  The macro defining the |\mytitle| command should call three macros,
% |\set@p@emtitle|, to set the title in the main text and make the
% label for use by the contents and notes sections, |\c@ntentsinfo| to
% set the title in the table of contents, and |\t@xtnotesinfo|, which
% sets the title in the notes sections.  (You should enclose the whole thing
% between |\makeatletter| and |\makeatother|.) 

% |\set@p@emtitle|
% takes six arguments, which are, in order, (1) the title (which, if
% you are calling this command inside of the definition of |\mytitle|
% should just be |#1|), (2) commands to be issued before setting the
% title (minimally, a penalty, such as |\poemtitlepenalty|), (3) the
% font size in which the title is to be set in the text (such as
% |\poemtitlefont| or |\large|), (4) any indentation of the title
% (|\relax| for |\poemtitle|, or |\titleindent| for
% |\sequencesectiontitle|), (5) commands to be issued after the
% title is set (such as |\afterpoemtitleskip|) and (6) the amount 
% overrun lines in the title should be indented.  

%|\c@ntentsinfo| takes
% four arguments, which are, in order, (1) the title, (2) the
% indentation of the title in the table of contents (such as
% |\contentsindentone|), (3), the font size in which the title
% should be set (such as |\contentspoemtitlefont|) and (4) the amount 
% overrun lines in the table of contents should be indented (such as 
% |\contentsindenttwoamount|). 

%  |\t@xtnotesinfo|
% takes one argument, the title. 

%  So, for example, to create a new kind of title called |\mytitle| which looks
% just like |\poemtitle|, issue
% \begin{verbatim}
% \makeatletter
% \newcommand{\mytitle}[1]{%
% \set@p@emtitle{#1}{\poemtitlepenalty}{\poemtitlefont}%
% {\relax}{\nobreak\par\nobreak\afterpoemtitleskip\nobreak}{\z@}%
% \c@ntentsinfo{#1}{\contentsindentone}{\contentspoemtitlefont}%
% {\contentsindenttwoamount}%
% \t@xtnotesinfo{#1}%
% }
% \makeatother
% \end{verbatim}
%
% (The |\z@| which is the sixth argument to |\set@p@emtitle| above is
% a constant set to zero. You will also notice that I became completely hysterical
% on the subject of preventing a page break after a poem title.)

% By default, \textsf{poemscol} 
% does not indent the overrun portion of titles relative to the first 
% line of the title, but if that first line is indented will set the 
% overrun portions to be indented the same amount. Overrun portions 
% of titles in the table of contents will be indented by one 
% |\contentsindentamount| more than the first line is indented. Both 
% of these behaviors can be changed by changing the arguments to 
% |\set@p@emtitle| or |\c@ntentsinfo|. 
% 
% If you wish to design a title which might have multiple lines, 
% and you wish to specify how those lines are broken up, you
% will need to write three macros: one for the first line, one for
% middle lines, and one for the last lines. 
% (This only matters if you care how the title is broken up. You 
% can choose to let \LaTeX\ do the breaking if you wish.) Before issuing
% |\set@p@emtitle| issue |\firstlinesettings|, |\middlelinesettings|,
% or |\lastlinesettings| (as the case may require).  And issue
% |\restoresinglelinesettings| last of all in each of your three
% macros.  The lines will be broken in the table of contents and in
% the body of the text in the same way, but will be run in in the
% notes sections.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\JHpoemtitle}
% In his edition of the poetry of Jos\'e Maria Heredia, Tilmann 
% Altenberg placed a marker in the margin next to poem titles with a
% reference to where in the apparatus notes on that poem could be
% found.  To do this, use the |\JHpoemtitle| command.  This command
% takes two arguments: first, the title of the poem, second, the label
% used by the |\label| command on the page of the notes section to
% which the title refers.  So, you would issue the poem title command
% this way: |\JHpoemtitle{Los desvelados}{EP_LosDesvelados_AC}|.  Up to
% version 2.49 of \textsf{poemscol} you had to be sure to define the
% label in the notes sections by issuing
% |\sources{\label{EP_LosDesvelados_AC}}|.  This is no longer
% necessary, and |\JHpoemtitle| defines both the |\label| and the
% |\pageref|.  Instructions are given in section \ref{JHpoemtitle},
% p.~\pageref{JHpoemtitle} for how to construct similar commands for
% sequences, sequence sections, and so on.
% 
% The following related commands are defined already 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item |\JHsequencetitle|, \item |\JHsequencefirstsectiontitle|, 
% \item |\JHsequencesectiontitle|, \item |\JHsequencesubsectiontitle|,  
% \item |\JHpoemsectiontitle|,   \item |\JHpoemfirstsectiontitle|, 
% \item |\JHpoemsubtitle|,  \item |\JHepigraph|,\item  |\JHprosesectiontitle|, and 
% \item |\JHdedication|.\end{itemize}
% 
% If you are using |\JHpoemtitle| and its siblings, you need to be
% sure to add \textsf{mparhack} to your package list.  You can prevent
% the marginal reference from switching sides on alternate pages by issuing 
% |\@mparswitchfalse| (be sure to put |\makeatletter| and 
% |\makeatother| around this command). You can control the side on 
% which the marginal reference appears with |\normalmarginpar| (to 
% place them on the right) or |\reversemarginpar| (to place them on 
% the left). |\JHpoemtitle| and its siblings place the marginal 
% reference using |\marginpar|.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\setmpargpoemtitle}
% |\setmargpoemtitle{}{}| is a more general version of 
% |\JHpoemtitle{}{}|, with the second argument being any commands you 
% want to be issued while the title is being processed.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\margreftextnote}
% Another feature of Altenberg's Heredia edition is a marginal mark 
% attached to lines to which text notes refer showing where in the 
% apparatus a comment upon that line is to be found. 
% |\margreftextnote| sets a label in the textual notes section, and 
% set a marginal note with a page reference to that label. Issue 
% |\margreftextnote| \emph{before} issuing the |\verseline| or 
% |\end{stanza}| that closes the line to which it refers. (The textual 
% note itself can be an ordinary |\textnote|, and should be place, as 
% usual, \emph{after} the |\verseline| or |\end{stanza}|.
% 
% |\margreftextnote| generates its own label, so there is no need to 
% make up one yourself. 
% 
% |\margreftextnote| uses |\marginpar| rather 
% than |\pmclsidepar| to set the note, because I had to use 
% |\marginpar| for |\JHpoemtitle| and its siblings, and I wanted the 
% whole family of markers to be controlled by the same settings. You 
% use the settings that control the behavior of |\marginpar| (e.g. 
% |\mparswitch| and |\reversemarginpar|) to control the behavior of 
% these marks. 
% 
% \begin{sloppypar}
% If you define a new endnote type using |\definenewnotetype|,
% |\definenewnotetype| will also define a new |\margref| command to go
% with it.\end{sloppypar}
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\setmargrefmarker} Altenberg's edition used a ding 
% from the pifonts collection in the marginal marks made by 
% |\margreftextnote| and its siblings. I have set the default to 
% |\dag|, so as not to depend upon yet another style package. You can 
% choose another mark using |\setmargrefmarker| (e.g. 
% |\setmargrefmarker{\ding{228}}|).
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\margrefemendation} |\margrefemendation| is a 
% version of |\margreftextnote| for emendations.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\margrefexplanatory}|\margrefexplanatory| is a 
% version of |\margreftextnote| for explanatory notes.
%
% \subsection{~Quoted Verse}
% Sometimes you wish to quote verse within verse (as when a speaker 
% in a verse play quotes a poem). \DescribeMacro{\quotedverse} The 
% |quotedverse| environment is desiged for this contingency.
% 	
% \subsection{~Visual formatting}
% \DescribeMacro{\longpage}
% \DescribeMacro{\shortpage}
% The ideal in \LaTeX\ is to separate 
% content markup and formatting as completely as possible. In the text 
% itself you simply mark the logical units (a poem, a title, a stanza, 
% a textual note), and a header program like this interprets the 
% meaning of those terms typographically. However, one still winds up 
% having to do some visual formatting. Especially in prose sections, 
% such as in the textual notes, you will sometimes have to enlarge or 
% shrink a page by one line in order to avoid an intractable widow or 
% club line, and when one does so one must be careful to do the same to 
% the other member of the two-page spread of which that page is a part
% so that the spread will be properly balanced. 
% These commands enable one to wiggle pagelength enough to handle these 
% problems. Since verse sections should be set with |\raggedbottom| 
% in effect, the commands are not necessary in verse sections.
%
% |\longpage| and |\shortpage| are cumulative: issuing |\longpage| twice lengthens the
% page by two lines, and issuing  |\shortpage| twice shortens the page by two lines.
% 
% \section{Customizing page geometry}
% 
% 
% \subsection{~Font sizes, skips, sinks, indents, and penalties}
% 
% \label{changingfontsandleading}
% \textsf{poemscol} sets the font sizes, but not the font family, of

% poetry, and the endnotes sections. ``Volumefirststyle'' is for the 
% first page of a volume of poems. ``Volumetitlestyle'' is for the 
% title page of a volume of poems. The external file for the table of

% \subsection{~Page geometry and type leading}
% 
% You have to give geometry the values that suit you.  I include the
% values I used in my own book, just to give you a starting place.
%  The default values for marginparsep and

%% 
%% In my own book I also, strictly to save money, and at the price of
%% some ugliness, changed the definition of |\normalsize| and |\small|,
%% so that the former was 10 pt type on 11 pt leading (rather than 12
%% pt), and that the latter was 9 pt type on 10 pt leading.  You can
%% reproduce this setting by issuing |\tightleading|, although I would

% \section{Prose Sections with Line Numbers} \label{prosesections} \textsf{poemscol}
% uses the \textsf{lineno} package to make marginal line numbers for
% prose sections such as the Author's Introduction, Afterword,
% Author's Notes, or such prose interludes or prose poems the volume
% may include.  To control the appearance, placement, and frequency of
% marginal line numbers in prose sections, you may wish to consult the
% manual to \textsf{lineno}.  I have added a minimal user interface to
% make \textsf{lineno} cohere with poemscol.  You may have to fiddle
% with the parameters of both \textsf{poemscol} and \textsf{lineno} to
% persuade them to set marginal line numbers that look the same way in
% prose and verse contexts.  The default values should work as is.
%
% Line numbers in prose sections are placed using a different
% |\length| from that used in verse sections.  Essentially, verse
% sections, and prose sections which use paragraph and sentence
% numbering --- see below, in section \ref{paragraphsentence} ---
% place the marginal line numbers using |\marginparsep|.  Prose
% sections which are numbered by line use |\linenumbersep| instead,
% which is a length defined in the \textsf{lineno} package. I have
% given values for both lengths which seem to place line numbers on
% the left and on the right side in prose sections roughly where they
% are placed in verse sections.  You can change these values with
% |\setcounter{countername}{length}|.
%
% |\verselinenumberstoleft| and |\verselinenumberstoright| also place
% the line numbers to the left or to the right, respectively, in prose
% sections.  If you wish the numbering to appear on a different side
% in prose contexts you can set the side by issuing |\leftlinenumbers|
% or |\rightlinenumbers|.  These last are commands from the
% \textsf{lineno} package.  The two forms in which line numbers switch
% sides in prose contexts can't at the moment be used, because of a
% clash between how \textsf{lineno} handles line numbers that switch
% sides and the way I pass the line numbers to notes sections.  If you
% have set the verse line numbers to switch sides, prose line numbers
% will appear on the right side.  I hope soon to find a workaround for
% this problem.
%
% By default, the line modulo for prose sections is the same as that for 
% verse sections; if you have a line number every 5 lines in verse, 
% you will have the same in prose. You can set the prose line modulo 
% independently with |\setprosemodulo|.
% 
% \textsf{poemscol} may deal with rather long stretches of prose, but
% it is not designed to be used for critical editions of extended
% prose texts, as \texttt{EDMAC}, \textsf{ledmac}, or \textsf{ednotes}
% are.  The method of entering line ranges into notes in prose
% contexts is something of a hack, and rather a worse one than the one
% employed in verse contexts, since it involves using two labels for
% each note, one to capture the line number of the beginning, the
% other to capture the line number of the end.  Other limitations of
% this method may show up with longer prose extracts.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\prosesectiontitle} Prose sections may be titled with
% |\prosesectiontitle{}| which is essentially just |\poemtitle|, or
% |\prosesectiontitlenotitle|, which is essentially just
% |\poemtitlenotitle|.  (Remember that if you use the latter command,
% you must specify a ``dummy'' title to use in the note and contents
% sections.)  They will be formatted in the notes and contents
% sections as poems are.  Alternatively, you can use
% |\literalcontents| and |\literaltextnotes| to set such titles as you
% please.
% 
%\DescribeMacro{prosesection}
% Prose sections should be enclosed in a |prosesection| environment
% (between |\begin{prosesection}| and |\end{prosesection}|).  Entering
% this environment sets the modulo repeat for line numbering to the
% same value that prevails in verse contexts, and resets the prose
% line number to zero.  If for some reason you do not wish to reset
% the line number but continue on from where it left off at the end of
% the last prose section, use the |prosesectionnoreset| environment
% instead.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\setprosemodulo}
% If you wish to set the modulo repeat for line numbering in prose to 
% some value different for that from verse contexts, issue the new 
% modulo as the argument to |\setprosemodulo{}|.
% 
% 
% It is possible, if a prose section is interpolated in the midst of
% verse, to number the prose and verse continuously.  To move from a
% verse passage to a prose passage, just before the |\end{poem}| at
% the end of the first verse passage issue |\saveverselinenumber| to
% save the number of the verse passage.  After you issue
% |\begin{prosesection}| issue
% |\resetlinenumber[\theverselineumberscratch]| to apply that number
% to the prose section.  To number continuously while moving from
% prose to verse is more tricky.  One way might be to mark a label at
% the end of the prose passage with |\proselinelabel{prose end label}|
% (or some other suitably unique label).  This label will record the
% line number of the last prose line.  Pass that value to
% |\restoreverselinenumber| by issuing
% |\setcounterfromref{verselinenumberscratch}{prose end label}|.  Then
% issue |\restoreverselinenumber| just after issuing the
% |\begin{poem}| that restarts the verse again.  I would recommend
% against numbering verse and prose continuously, however, since a
% verse line and a prose line are different categories of thing, the
% one being an element of prosody, the other being only an element of
% typography.
% 
%
% \DescribeMacro{\proselinelabel}
% |\proselinelabel| is simply |\linelabel| from \textsf{lineno}. I 
% have provided the new name to make it easy to distinguish from 
% |\poemlinelabel|. 
%
% 
%
% \DescribeMacro{\prosetextnote}
% \DescribeMacro{\prosemendation}
% \DescribeMacro{\proseexplanatory}
% Special versions of |\textnote|, |\emendation| and |\explanatory|
% are available for use in prose sections.  |\prosetextnote|,
% |\proseemendation|, and |\proseexplanatory| differ from the verse
% versions in that they each require an extra argument, a unique label
% to be used in locating the line number for use by the notes
% commands.  If |\maketextnotes|, |\makeemendations|, or
% |\makeexplanatorynotes| have been issued, the endnotes will be sent
% to the usual sections, where all the notes from that prose section
% will be grouped into a paragraph, with the entry headed by the title
% given by |\prosesectiontitle{}|, just as if that were the title of a
% poem.  |\textnotesatfoot|, |\emendationsatfoot|, and
% |\explanationsatfoot| will send the notes from prose contexts to the
% usual footnote levels.  Notes commands in prose contexts take three
% arguments.  As in verse sections, in prose sections textnotes,
% explanatory notes, and emendations have an optional first argument
% for recording line ranges.  As in verse sections, you can record
% these line ranges either by simply putting in the argument how many
% lines the lemma will refer to (a deprecated method retained for
% backward compatibility reasons), or the argument of a
% |\proselinelabel| command on the last line of the lemma.  (The only
% difference from the verse version here is that you should make the
% label using the |\proselinelabel| command, rather than with the
% |\poemlinelabel| command.)  The second argument is a label to
% identify each note uniquely, which is used to find the line number 
% at which the note begins.  You will need a different label for
% every note.  The third argument is the text of the note, which
% should include both the lemma and the rest of the note, as in the 
% notes for verse sections.
% |\proseemendation[]{}{}| and
% |\proseexplanatory[]{}{}| are coded the same way. So, if you wished 
% to make a textual note on a passage that begins with ``Call me 
% Ishmael.'' and ends ``a way of driving away the spleen,'' you would 
% issue at the point where the note is to 
% occur (at the beginning of the passage):
% \begin{verbatim}
% \prosetextnote[a way of driving away the spleen] {Call me Ishmael}
% {Call me Ishmael \ldots\ a way of driving away the spleen] text of
% textual note} \end{verbatim} On the
% last line of the passage to which the note refers you would 
% issue: \\ |\proselinelabel{a way of driving away the spleen}|.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\prosetsvariant}
% \DescribeMacro{\proseaccidental}
% \DescribeMacro{\prosetsaccidental}
% You can issue |\sources| and |\tsentry| in prose contexts as usual. 
% For typescript variants and accidental variants you need to issue 
% |\prosetsvariant[]{}{}|, |\proseaccidental{}{}|, and 
% |\prosetsaccidental{}{}|. |\prosetsvariant| is entered just as 
% |\prosetextnote[]{}{}| is, with an optional argument (for use with 
% line ranges, as usual), and two mandatory arguments (the first a 
% label to capture the line number, the second the lemma and comment).
%
% |\proseaccidental| and |\prosetsaccidental| take only the two
% mandatory arguments, since by definition an accidental variant is
% confined to one line.
% 
% One caveat: because the line numbers for notes in prose contexts
% are generated by a label/ref mechanism, each note will result in a
% complaint about an undefined reference the first time the file is run through
% \LaTeX.  Either run the first pass in quiet mode, or be prepared to
% ignore a lot of griping until
% \LaTeX\ has generated the .aux file at the end of the first run.
%
% \section{Paragraph and Sentence Annotation}\label{paragraphsentence}
% \subsection{~Setup}
% Annotating a prose section by sentence number, or by paragraph number and 
% sentence number, has some advantages over annotating it by line 
% number. The principal advantage is that the annotation and reference 
% system can remain stable over multiple editions, even if they are set 
% in different formats. The most familiar of such systems is the 
% chapter and verse system in the Bible, introduced by Archbishop 
% Stephen Langton in the thirteenth century (who divided the Vulgate 
% edition into numbered chapters) and by Robert Estienne in the 
% sixteenth century (who added the verse numbers). Such a form of 
% annotation might be especially useful for medieval prosimetra, a form 
% combining verse and prose. (Hence the commands that follow often 
% begin with |pm|.)
% 
% \DescribeMacro{pmsection}
% You should put prose marked up for sentence and paragraph 
% annotation in a |pmsection| environment.
% You do not need to put prose marked up for sentence and paragraph 
% annotation in a |prosesection| environment. That environment is 
% only needed if you are line-numbering prose. You also do not need 
% to load the \textsf{lineno} package if you are using the sentence 
% and paragraph system for annotating prose. You might, however, 
% still wish to set the title with |\prosesectiontitle|.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\setprosebysentence} 
% |\setprosebysentence| sets \textsf{poemscol} to number prose by
% sentence rather than by line number.  This command is mostly a
% placeholder now, used only for setting the value of |\marginparsep|
% to something better for prose.  (|\marginparsep| sets how far the
% line numbers are from the text block.)  |\verselinenumberstoleft|,
% |\verselinenumberstoright|, and |\verselinenumbersswitch| each pick
% convenient values for |\marginparsep|.  By default these values all
% line up on the page, but if you change any of them, you may have to
% use reset |\marginparsep| to some value you will have to find by
% trial and error, since they each use |\marginparsep| in slightly
% different ways.  You can change |\marginparsep| either by using
% |\setlength{\marginparsep}{length}| or, better, by using
% |\renewcommand| to change the setting of |\marginparsep| in
% |\verselinenumberstoleft| or whatever else you intend to use.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\pmsentence} Each sentence must begin with
% |\pmsentence|.  |\pmsentence| increments the sentence counter,
% optionally puts the sentence number in the running text, and
% optionally puts the sentence number in the margin.  
%
% |\runningsentencenumberstrue|
% sets sentence
% numbers in the running text.
% To set sentence numbers in the margin, issue
% |\marginsentencenumberstrue|. You can issue both, either, or neither of 
% these commands. 
%
% \DescribeMacro{\setpmmodulo} If you are putting sentence numbers in
% the margin, you need not number every sentence.  Indeed, if there is
% more than one sentence on a line, the numbers will overwrite each
% other (unless you use the marn.sty package, and substitute |\marn|
% for |\pmclrightsidepar|, |\pmclleftsidepar| or |\pmclsidepar| in the
% code for |\pmsentence|).  You can also avoid overlapping sentence
% numbers by using |\pmsentencetwo| and its siblings, defined below.
% You can set the modulo for sentence marginal numbers by issuing
% |\setpmmodulo{}|.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\pmsentencetwo}
% \DescribeMacro{\pmsentencethree}
% \DescribeMacro{\pmsentencefour} If you know, from a prior run, 
% that there will be a second or third sentence on some particular 
% line, marking them with these commmands will ensure that the 
% marginal sentence numbers do not overwrite each other. These macros 
% are something of a kludge, but they will do until I figure out how 
% to do this better.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\pmnumberstoright}
% \DescribeMacro{\pmnumberstoleft}
% \DescribeMacro{\pmnumbersgutter}
% \DescribeMacro{\pmnumbersouter}
% If you wish to control the
% margin in which sentence and paragraph numbers appear, issue
% |\pmnumbersright|, |\pmnumbersleft|, |\pmnumbersgutter|, or
% |\pmnumbersouter|.  By default, these numbers will line up with the
% line numbers in verse sections.  If you change the value of
% |\marginparsep| for prose sections from those used by their verse
% equivalents, it is a good idea to issue the verse equivalent command
% (|\versenumberstoright| or whatever) again when you move from a
% prose to a verse environment.
% 
%
% |\runningsentencenumberformat| sets the format of running sentence
% numbers.  Currently it is |\textsuperscript| and |\tiny|.  You can
% change this with |\renewcommand|.  The format of marginal sentence
% numbers is set by |\marginsentencenumberformat|.  Currently it is
% |\tiny|.  You can change this with |\renewcommmand|.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\pmpara}
% \DescribeMacro{\pmsentencebypara}
% \DescribeMacro{\pmsparainmartrue}
% \DescribeMacro{\pmpararunningtrue}
% You can also number paragraphs.  Each paragraph must begin with
% |\pmpara|.  |\pmpara| increments the paragraph counter, optionally
% puts the paragraph number in the running text, and optionally puts
% the paragraph number in the margin.  To reset the sentence counter
% at the beginning of each paragraph, issue |\pmsentencebyparatrue| in
% your preamble.  To set paragraph numbers in the margin, issue
% |\pmparainmartrue|.  To set paragraph numbers in the running text,
% issue |\pmpararunningtrue|. You can issue both, either, or neither of 
% these last two commands. Which margin these numbers are set in
% is controlled by the same commands that control placement of
% marginal sentence numbers.
% 
% If you begin a paragraph with |\pmpara| \textsf{poemscol} will 
% assume that you intend to include the paragraph number in your 
% notes (in the form \emph{paragraph: sentence:} for simple 
% references, or \emph{firstparagraph: firstsentence: -- 
% lastparagraph: lastentence:} for ranges of sentences) even if you do not reset 
% the sentence number at the beginning of each paragraph. Normally 
% you would not issue |\pmpara| if you are not resetting the sentence 
% number at the beginning of each paragraph, since under those 
% circumstances you don't really need to keep track of the paragraph 
% numbers, in which case each note would simply include the sentence 
% number (just as in verse it would include the line number). In the 
% unusual event in which you wish to put the paragraph number in the 
% margin but refer only to sentence numbers in the notes, simply 
% follow every use of |\pmpara| with |\pmparasfalse|.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\pmpararunningformat}\DescribeMacro{\pmparmarformat}
% The format of running paragraph numbers is set 
% by |\pmparrunningformat|. Currently it is 
% |\textbf| and |\small|.
% The format of marginal paragraph numbers is set by 
% |\pmparmarformat|. Currently it is 
% |\textbf| and |\small|. Either can 
% be changed with |\renewcommand|.
% 
% \subsection{~Cross Reference by Sentence and Paragraph}
% \DescribeMacro{\sentencelabel}
% To make labels that refer to sentences or paragraphs, issue
% |\sentencelabel{}|.  The label will be either both the paragraph
% number and the sentence number (if you are resetting sentence numbers
% by paragraph), or only the sentence number (if you are not resetting
% sentence numbers by paragraph).
% 
% \subsection{~End notes by Sentence and Paragraph}
% 
% \begin{sloppypar}
% \DescribeMacro{\pmtextnote}
% \DescribeMacro{\pmexplanatory}
% \DescribeMacro{\pmemendation}
% \DescribeMacro{\pmaccidental}
% \DescribeMacro{\pmtsvariant}
% \DescribeMacro{\pmtsaccidental}
% |\pmtextnote|, |\pmexplanatory|, |\pmemendation|, |\pmaccidental|,
% |\pmtsvariant| and |\pmtsaccidental| are special versions of the
% usual endnote commands for use with annotations by sentence and
% paragraph.  If you have not issued |\pmsentencebypara| these
% commands will write the sentence number at the head of each note,
% where the line number would usually go.  If you have issued
% |\pmsentencebypara|, these commands will issue both the paragraph
% and sentence number, in the format \textless paragraph
% number\textgreater:\textless sentence number\textgreater.  You can
% refer to ranges of sentences (or paragraphs and sentences) in a way
% very similar to how you do so in verse sections.  At the end of the
% range, issue a |\sentencelabel| command, with a unique label.  At
% the beginning of the range, issue your |\pmtextnote| command with the
% optional argument in square brackets before the main argument,
% giving your unique label as the value of that argument, e.g.
% |\pmtextnote[some label]{text of lemma] comment}|.  At the end of 
% your range, issue |\sentencelabel{some label}|, using the same 
% label you put in the square brackets for the |\pmtextnote|. If you have not
% issued |\pmsentencebypara|, the range will simply be the range of
% sentence numbers.  If you have issued |\pmsentencebypara|, the range
% will include paragraph and sentence numbers, like this:
% 4:12--6:13.\end{sloppypar}
% 
% |\sources| needs no special handling if you are annotating by 
% sentence and paragraph.
% 
% \subsection{~Footnotes by Sentence and Paragraph}
% |\textnoteatfoot| shifts |\pmtextnotes| to the foot, as with 
% |\prosetextnote|. |\emendationsatfoot| and |\explanationsatfoot| 
% work the same way.
% \subsection{~Bible Chapter and Verse}
% Since |\pmsentence| and |\pmpar| are the moral equivalents of bible 
% verse and chapter, |\biblechapter| and |\bibleverse| are provided 
% for convenience.

% \section{Parallel Text Editions} \label{parallelhack}
% \subsection{~Setup for Parallel Texts in Verse}
% \textsf{poemscol} can make parallel
% text editions in which the contrasting versions are set on facing
% verso and recto pages.  \textsf{poemscol} does not automatically provide the page
% breaks for parallel editions, and even if it did, one would still
% probably have to specify page breaks every two or three pages to keep
% the texts in register anyway, so you will have to use |\newpage|
% to mark every page break.  If you are willing to set the page breaks
% yourself, however, \textsf{poemscol} does provide macros for keeping the line count
% correct on successive recto or verso pages, and for keeping track of
% whether or not one was in the middle of a stanza when one closed the
% previous verso or recto page (as the case may be).  And it provides, in
% the |\synchrolabel| and |\synchroref| commands, a way of marking which
% lines on the recto side correspond to particular lines on the verso
% side.  |\synchroref| will even tag the marginal line number it makes
% with a marker to specify the text to which it refers.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\startparalleltexts}
% \DescribeMacro{\finishparalleltexts}
% \DescribeEnv{parallelverse}
% You must begin a region of parallel text on a \emph{verso} page. 
%  A parallel text region must begin with 
% |\startparalleltexts| and end with |\finishparalleltexts|. 
% Setting parallel texts requires one to redefine the poem and stanza 
% environments, and |\startparalleltexts| redefines those environments.
% You can make those changes local to the parallel text region by using 
% |\begin{parallelverse}|  and |\end{parallelverse}| rather than |\startparalleltexts|
% and |\finishparalleltexts|.
% |\startparalleltexts| and |\finishparalleltexts| can be issued on their own
% but I have combined them to make the |parallelverse| environment. 
%
% Although usually with \textsf{poemscol} it is up to you where to put 
% the marginal line numbers, when you issue |\startparalleltexts| the 
% positions are fixed as follows: marginal line numbers are in the left 
% margin, line cross references (marking which lines in the recto  text 
% correspond to which lines in the verso text, which 
% are made with |\synchroref|) are in the right margin.
% 
%
% \DescribeMacro{\startrectopage}
% \DescribeMacro{\finishrectopage}
% \DescribeMacro{\startversopage}
% \DescribeMacro{\finishversopage}
% Verso pages 
% should begin with |\startversopage| and end with |\finishversopage|.
% Recto pages should begin with |\startrectopage| and end with 
% |\finishrectopage|.  You have to declare the page breaks manually, 
% so be sure you are putting the |\finishversopage|  or |\finishrectopage| commands 
% in places which 
% will work. |\finishparalleltexts| just makes certain that stanzas, and poems
% that you opened in a region of parallel texts are closed when you leave it.
% 
% \DescribeMacro{\versopoemtitle}
% \DescribeMacro{\rectopoemtitle}
% \DescribeMacro{\versopoemtitlenocontents}
% \DescribeMacro{\rectopoemtitlenocontents}
% Use |\versopoemtitle| and |\rectopoemtitle| 
% rather than |\poemtitle| for the title of the poem (or prose passage)
% on the verso or recto pages.
% if you are making a parallel text of Wordsworth's 1805 and 1850
% versions of \emph{The Prelude}, you might want to use something
% like |\versopoemtitle{The Prelude (1805 Version)}| and 
% |\rectopoemtitle{The Prelude{1850 Version)}|.
% I have also made versions of these commands that do not make
% entries in the table of contents, should the need arise for them. 
% If you wish to make titles for other things,
% such as poetic sequences or sequence sections, you can use the techniques
% described in section \ref{customizing titles} above, page \pageref{customizing titles}, 
% except substitute the macro |\versoset@p@emtitle| 
% or |\rectoset@p@emtitle| for |\set@p@emtitle|, using
% all the same arguments you would have used with |\set@p@emtitle|.
%
%\subsection{~Parallel Texts and on the fly note types}
% If you are making a parallel text edition, you may need to 
% use |\definenewnotetype| to make the different kinds of endnote 
% for the parallel texts. For instance, 
% if you are making a parallel text of Wordsworth's 1805 and 1850
% versions of \emph{The Prelude}, you may use something like |\fiveexplanatory|
% and |\fiftyexplanatory| for explanatory notes for the poems on the verso 
% and recto pages. 
%
%
%  \DescribeMacro{\keeptitlestraight}
% Without special care, \textsf{poemscol} may become
% confused about whether it has seen, for example, a |\fiveexplanatory| for 
% a particular book of \emph{The Prelude} or not, and, if |\settitleinnotes| is set, 
% may neglect to put the 
% title of that book of \emph{The Prelude} in the notes 
% for the first note for that book. To remedy this, |\versopoemtitle|
% and |\rectopoemtitle| set up a way of keeping track whether each  species 
% of note has appeared already or not. 
%  While setting parallel texts \textsf{poemscol} checks at the beginning of every
%  verso or recto page whether the the different species of endnote for the poem on
%  that page has appeared before. On rare occasions this turns out not to be frequently
% enough in cases
% where you are defining your own kinds of endnote. 
% In this case, the following hack, |\keeptitlesstraight|, will check whether the verso or recto
% poem has set that species of note each time it is issued. Suppose, for instance,
% going back to our Wordsworth example, 
% that you have defined, using |\definenewnotetype|, the following six
% kinds of endnotes: |\fivetextnote| |\fiveemendation|, |\fiveexplanatory|,
% |\fiftytextnote|, |\fiftyemendation|, and |\fiftyexplanatory|. You should
% define a new command called |\keeptitlesstraight| to keep track of these six
% kinds of note. Here is  how it might look:
%
% \medskip
%
% \noindent|\newcommand{\keeptitlesstraight}{|\\
% |\pretocmd{\fivetextnote}{\versotitleinnotescheck}{\relax}{\relax}|
% |\pretocmd{\fiveemendation}{\versotitleinnotescheck}{\relax}{\relax}|
% |\pretocmd{\fiveexplanatory}{\versotitleinnotescheck}{\relax}{\relax}|
% |\pretocmd{\fiftytextnote}{\rectotitleinnotescheck}{\relax}{\relax}|
% |\pretocmd{\fiftyemendation}{\rectotitleinnotescheck}{\relax}{\relax}|
% |\pretocmd{\fiftyexplanatory}{\rectotitleinnotescheck}{\relax}{\relax}|
% |}|
%
% \medskip
%
% All those fields filled with |\relax| are for reporting the success of failure
% |\pretocmd| has had in appending |\versotitleinnotescheck| (or |\rectotitleinnotescheck|)
% to the different endnotes commands.  You may wish to replace
% the |\relax| with something like |\typeout{fiftytextnote modified}| or 
% |\typeout{fiftytextnote not modified}|. 
%
%If you are using the |\keeptitlestraight|
% hack described here, you should add \textsf{etoolbox}
% to your package list.
%
%  \DescribeMacro{\resettitleinnotes}
% If you are defining new kinds of note, and a section of 
% non-parallel texts follow a section of parallel texts, you
% will need to issue the following hack after the parallel texts close
% (again I am using the Wordsworth example):\\
% |\newcommand{\resettitleinnotes}{|\\
% |\nofiveemendationyettrue%|\\
% |\nofiveexplanatoryyettrue%|\\
% |\nofivetextnoteyettrue%|\\
% |\nofiftyemendationyettrue%|\\
% |\nofiftyexplanatoryyettrue%|\\

%  \DescribeMacro{\rectotexnote}
%  \DescribeMacro{\rectoemendation}
%  \DescribeMacro{\rectoexplanatory}
%  \DescribeMacro{\versotexnote}
%  \DescribeMacro{\versoemendation}
%  \DescribeMacro{\versoexplanatory}
% In case you find using these hacks a bit burdensome, 
%  I have defined for your convenience six generic kinds of endnote for use in parallel text
%  editions: |\rectotextnote|, |\rectoeemendation|, |\rectoexplanatory|,
%  |\versotextnote|, |\versoemendation|, and |\versoexplanatory,|  as well as |\rectoprosetexnote|,
% |\versoprosetextnote,| |\rectoproseemendation,| |\versoproseemendation|, 
% |\rectoproseexplanatory|, and |\versoproseexplanatory.| (I have also defined
% |\literalrectotextnote|, |\literalversotextnote|, |\literalrectoemendation|, |\literalversoemendation|,
% |\literalrectoexplain|, and |\literalversoexplain| for sending material other than formal
% endnotes to these endnote sections.
%  You can use all of these without issuing the moral equivalent of |\keeptitlesstraight| and 
% |\resettitleinnotes|.
%
%  \DescribeMacro{\makerectotexnote}
%  \DescribeMacro{\makerectoemendation}
%  \DescribeMacro{\makerectoexplanatory}
%To use these
% kind of note, issue |\makeversotextnotes|, |\makeversoemendations|, 
% |\makeversoexplanatorynotes| or their recto equivalents in your preamble. You can mark
% up your texts with these notes 
% just as you would do with  |\textnote|,  |\emendation| or |\explanatory| (or |\literalversotextnote|
% |\literalversoemend| and |\literalversoexplain|), without any of the special hacks
% I have just described.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\changerectotextnotesname}
% \DescribeMacro{\changerectotextnotesheader}
% \DescribeMacro{\rectotextnotessinglepar}
% \DescribeMacro{\rectotextnotessingletwocol}
% I have given the endnotes sections generated by these notes rather
% generic names (|\rectotextnote| and |\versotextnote| for instance, both open endnote sections
% with the title TEXTUAL NOTES, with a running header of the form ``Textual Notes to pp.~xx--yy''
% an a contents entry of Textual Notes).  You will probably need to change
% those to something more descriptive. You can change any of these with 
% |\changeversotextnotesname{Your Title}|, |\changeversotextnotesheader{Your running header}|,
% and |\changeversotextnotescontentsname{Your contents entry}|. 
% You can change the appearance of these notes
% by changing the values of the booleans |\versotextnotessinglepar| and |\versotextnotestwocol|.
% Similar sets of commands are available for |\versoemendation| and |\versoexplanatory|
% and their recto equivalents.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\putrectotextnotes}
% To include these note sections in your document, issue |\putversotextnotes|, |\putrectotextnotes|,
% |\putversoemendations|,  |\putrectoemendations|, |\putversoexplanatorynotes|, or 
% |\putrectoexplanatorynotes| at the point where you wish them to appear. These commands
% behave exactly like |\puttextnotes|.
%
% \subsection{~Parallel Text Labels}
% \DescribeMacro{\synchrolabel} \DescribeMacro{\synchroref}
% \DescribeMacro{\setsynchroflag} You may want to mark cross references
% to make it clear to the reader which line of the poem on the recto side
% of the spread corresponds to a particular line on the verso side.
% To mark these cross references, you
% need to make a label on the verso side (using |\syncrolabel|), and a corresponding
% reference on the recto side (using |\synchroref|).  You may also wish to add a mark to
% that reference (using |\setsynchroflag|) to specify to the reader what edition it refers to.  So, for
% instance, if your verso text is the 1805 version of Wordsworth's
% \emph{The Prelude}, and your recto text is the 1850 version, you may
% wish to specify |\setsynchroflag{1805: }|, which will preface the
% references put out by the |\synchroref| command with~`1805:~'.
% Suppose you wished to tie these corresponding passages from the ``Boy of Winander''
% episode in Book 3.   To make the label, issue the
% |\synchrolabel| command on the verso side (the 1805 side) just after the
% |\verseline| or |\end{stanza}| which closes the line you wish to
% label:
% 
% \begin{verbatim}
%This boy was taken from his mates, and died \verseline
%In childhood ere he was full ten years old \verseline
% \synchrolabel{full ten years old}
% \end{verbatim}
% You don't have to quote the whole line in the label, but it should be 
% long enough to uniquely pick out that line in the poem. (If the line 
% is repeated in the poem, you will have to exercise your ingenuity in 
% making up a unique label.)
% 
% Over on the recto side (the 1850 side), you will want to use |\synchroref| in order 
% to print the marginal cross reference. The |\synchroref| command 
% should come \emph{before} the |\verseline| that closes the line it is 
% tied to, as follows:
% 
% \begin{verbatim}
%This Boy was taken from his mates, and died\verseline
%In childhood, ere he was full twelve years old.
% \synchroref{full ten years old}}\verseline
% \end{verbatim}
%
% \subsection{~Parallel Prose Passages}
% \DescribeMacro{parallelprose}
% \DescribeMacro{\startparalleltextprose}
% \DescribeMacro{\finishparalleltextprose}
% \textsf{poemscol} is not designed to manage long parallel texts in prose,
% but for shorter texts up to a couple of dozen pages, such as 
% two versions of an Author's Preface, say, \textsf{poemscol} has the |parallelprose|
% environment. (You can also use |\startparalleltextprose| and |\finishparalleltextprose|.)
% Like passages of parallel text in verse, parallel prose passages must start
% on a verso page.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\startversoprosepage}
% \DescribeMacro{\finishversoprosepage}
% \DescribeMacro{\startrectoprosepage}
% \DescribeMacro{\finishrectoprosepage}
% Each verso page must start with |\startversoprosepage| and finish with 
% |\finishversoprosepage|, and each recto page must start with |\startrectoprosepage|
% and finish with |\finishrectoprosepage|. If a page continues a paragraph from the previous
% page, say, from a previous recto page, put the beginning of the 
% text on the second page right after the |\startrectopage| command with 
% no blank line. (Alternatively, you could just
% begin that page with |\noindent|.) 
%
% \DescribeMacro{\parastart}
% \DescribeMacro{\paraend}
% You must mark the beginning and end of every paragraph in parallel prose passages
% with |\parastart| and |\paraend|.
%
% You will have to pick the page breaks manually, using |\newpage|, once you find where
% \LaTeX\ would naturally break the page. Because how \LaTeX\ justifies text is a little
% unpredictable, however, you may find that the line before the page break, which filled 
% the line before you added the page break, is actually a little shorter, and thus is 
% no longer justified, once you add the page break. 
% To fix this, add an |\hfil| between each word of the last line.

%    \begin{macro}{\tightgeometry} There's no reason why you should use the
% page geometry I specify here. If you issue |\tightgeometry| in your 
% preamble, you will have the geometry I have used. If you issue 
% |\tightleading|  you will 
% redefine |\normalsize| and |\small| to use tighter leading. 
%  Normal
% 10 point \LaTeX\ uses 12 point leading.  Strictly to save money, I
% redefined |\normalsize| to use 11 point leading.  
% I use the \textsf{geometry} package,
% since it's simpler to figure out.  I give my page geometry here
% chiefly to remind the reader of some important variables that should
% be kept track of, such as marginparsep, which controls the
% separation of the marginal line numbers from the verse line,
% marginparwidth, which controls how wide the block for the marginal
% line numbers will be, headsep, which controls how far the text will
% be from the running headers, and footskip, which controls how far
% the last verse line will be from the marker which tells the reader
% that there is a stanza break at the end of the page (if there is
% one).  I've also set the odd side margin and the even side margin
% for two-sided printing.  Finally, I have set the default handling
% of page endings to |\raggedbottom|.  Verse should always be set with
% a ragged bottom margin, otherwise \LaTeX\ will stretch the spaces
% between stanzas to make the bottom perfectly flush.  When you enter
% prose sections, such as the editor's introduction, you should enter
% the command |\flushbottom| to make sure that the prose sections have

% \subsubsection{Internal font size commands} You will probably never need 
% to use these font commands explicitly. I defined these for internal 
% use within \textsf{poemscol}, so that a command will always call the 
% same fonts.
% 
% As a way of making global changes to repeated features I have
% defined various special fonts for special purposes.  For instance,
% in a Collected Poems in which the poems are arranged by volume, with
% divider pages for the beginning of each volume, the first command
% sets the font for the volume title on the divider page, using the
% default font family, setting it in 18 point type on 23 point
% leading.  The second command, as the name of the command indicates,
% sets the font for the subtitle of the volume to be 14 point type on
% 18 point leading.  You can change these either by changing the
% values in your (renamed) style file, or by using |\renewcommand|. 
% For instance, you can change the font parameters for the font for
% setting poem titles from 14 on 18 to 12 on 14 by issuing
% |\renewcommand{\poemtitlefont}{\fontsize{12}{14}\selectfont}| in
% your preamble.  Notice that there are special fonts for titles in
% the back matter and in the table of contents as well.

% \subsection{~Miscellaneous dimensions and constants}
% \textsf{poemscol} sets relatively large penalties for widows and
% clubs, both in the main text, and in the notes sections.  There are
% also special penalties after volume titles in the notes sections,
% since one does not want to leave a volume title in the notes
% sections stranded at the bottom of a page.  (Setting penalties may
% not automatically solve all the problems, however.  You can fix an
% intractable widow problem in the contents or in the notes sections
% by issuing |\literalcontents{\pagebreak}| or
% |\literalemend{\pagebreak}| just before you issue the
% |\poemtitle{}| or |\volumetitle{}| that resulted in the problematic
% title line.)  \textsf{poemscol} also manipulates penalties for places like
% the space between a poem's title and its first line.  It defines
% special values for the white space before and after poems and for
% the amount of a stanza break.  |\contentsindentone|,
% |\contentsindenttwo|, and so on are amounts to indent different
% hierarchical levels, say of poetic sequences and subsequences, in
% the table of contents.

%  last partial line if the line numbers are on the right. If you 
%  have issued |\tweakbrokenline| in your preamble, the setting of 
%  runover lines may not be consistent with the setting of broken 
%  lines, because the line number will be set on the level of the end 
%  of the line. This is not a problem if the line numbers are set on 
%  the right, but it may look odd if the numbers are set on the left.
%  |\startverseline| will ensure that the line number marks the 
%  beginning of any line it begins. If you put |\startverseline| at 
%  the beginning of the runover lines, it will ensure that the line 
%  number marks the beginning, not the end, of the line. If you wish 
%  |\startverseline| to align the number with the beginning of 
%  runover lines when the line number is on the left, and with the 
%  end of runover lines when the line number is on the right, issue 
%  |\tweakstartverseline| in your preamble.

% \subsection{~Setup for contents, textual notes, emendations, and explanatory notes}
%  First, the table of contents:
%  \begin{macro}{\makepoemcontents}
%  An external file is created with the extension .ctn, and the 
% filename of your driver file. The 
% channel to that file is called |\poemcontents|. The rest of the 
% command is the page style for the contents section. You will notice 
% the running head Contents, and the title of the Contents section. I am 
% assuming that the table of contents starts on page 5, but it may be 
% different in different books. 
% If you want to change that page 
% number (say, to page 3) without messing with this file, issue 
% |\literalcontents{\setcounter{page}{3}}| just after you issue 
% |\makepoemcontents| Alternatively, you can issue |\makepoemcontents{}| with its
% optional argument, putting the page number in the argument.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newtoks{\pmclcontentsname}
\pmclcontentsname={CONTENTS}
\newtoks{\pmclcontentsheader}
\pmclcontentsheader={Contents}
\newcommand{\changecontentsname}[1]{%

%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{macro}

% Next, the textual collations:
%    \begin{macro}{\maketextnotes} Like the |\makecontents| macro, 
% |\maketextnotes| opens an external file using |\jobname|, this time with the extension .ent. It 
% makes sure that line numbering is on (since it makes no sense to make 
% notes without numbering the lines, particularly since the 
% |\textnote{}| macro uses the line number). And it makes sure that the 
% notes section is set with a flush bottom line, rather than with the 
% ragged bottom line used for the verse sections. Also, it sets a 
% label for sending the page number of the textual notes to the table of 
% contents. 
%
% First, a few commands for use by all of the endnotes 
% sections. |\setendnotessectiontitledefaults| sets the title of the endnotes section
% at the top of the first page of that species of note, and takes six arguments,
% which are, in order, (1) the title  of the endnote section, (2) 
% commands to be issued before setting the
% title (minimally, a penalty, such as |\poemtitlepenalty|), (3) the
% font size in which the title is to be set in the text (such as
% |\poemtitlefont| or |\large|), (4) any indentation of the title
% (|\relax| to put the title where |\poemtitle| puts it, or |\titleindent| to put it where
% |\sequencesectiontitle| puts it), (5) commands to be issued after the
% title is set (such as |\afterpoemtitleskip|) and (6) the label to 
% be used for this section, to be used to set the page number in the 
% table of contents.
%
% |\setendnotessectiontitle| is a simpler version of |\setendnotessectiontitledefaults|
% with all the defaults filled in, leaving only two arguments, the 
% title of the section, and the label for use by the table of 
% contents.
%
% |\contentsendnotesdefaults| sets the defaults for the table of 
% contents entries for endnotes sections. It takes four arguments
% which are, in order, (1) the title of the endnote section, (2) the
% indentation of the title in the table of contents (such as
% |\contentsindentone|), (3), the font size in which the title
% should be set (such as |\contentspoemtitlefont|) and (4) the amount 
% overrun lines in the table of contents should be indented (such as 
% |\contentsindenttwoamount|).
%
% |\contentsendnotesindent| sets the default indent for table of 
% contents entries for endnotes sections, and |\contentsendnotesfont| 
% sets the default font for the.
%
% |\contentsendnotestitle| is a simpler command for sending 
% information about endnote sections to the table of contents, taking 
% only two arguments, the title and the label used for page reference 
% purposes.

% \subsection{~Commands for setting titles of poems and sequences}
% First, commands for sending labels to the table of contents and to 
% the notes sections. Since these are internal commands, not intended 
% to be issued in the body of the text, they might have been marked out 
% with ``at'' signs to prevent accidental redefinition. But since they 
% are repeatedly written out to the external files, it seemed more 
% economical to run the risk of redefinition than to write out 
% |\makeatletter| and |\makeatother| with every note.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newcommand{\makepoemlabel}[1]{\label{#1}}
\newcommand{\argpageref}[1]{\pageref{#1}}
%    \end{macrocode}
%  \subsubsection{Poem Titles} 
%  \begin{macro}{\poemtitle}\label{poemtitlecode}
% All of the other commands in this section are variations on this
% one, changing the penalties, the skips, the indentations, and the
% fonts.  The command breaks into three sections.  First, the title
% is set in the text.  |\poemtitlepenalty| tests whether there is
% room for the title and the first couple of lines.  |\poemtitlefont|
% globally sets the fonts for all poem titles.  You can put the
% argument in an |\hbox{}| to make sure that the poem title is not
% broken across two lines, and the |\label| records the page for the
% contents and notes sections.  |\afterpoemtitleskip| is the amount
% of white space after a poem title.  |\fulltitleholder| and
% |\@compoundlabelscratch| record the title for concatenation later.
% All of these commands can manage titles with control sequences in
% them, such as for italics or international characters.  In an
% earlier version there were special commands for such titles, using
% two arguments (one with the control sequence, one without it).
% Those commands are no longer necessary, but have been retained for
% backward compatibility with earlier versions.
% 
% Second, the poem is entered in the external file for the table of 
% contents. |\contentsindentone| sets it in one level in the hierarchy 
% of indentations, and |\contentspoemtitlefont| is the type size used 
% for poems in the table of contents. The |\pageref{}| holds the page 
% number of the poem. 
% 
% Third, a new paragraph is opened in the textual notes for textual 
% collations. |\@poempagetotextnotes{}| sends the page number to the 
% textual notes. |\@poemtitletotextnotes{}| sends the title.

% closed, to reopen on the next page of the same kind (recto or verso).

% not be changed (so that it will still reflect whether the reader 
% should understand there to be a stanza break at the bottom of the 
% page or not). The second boolean for each case of artificial closure

% Macros for line cross references:
% 
% You will probably want to use line cross references to show which
% lines on the recto page correspond to which lines on the verso page.
% When you do this, you will set, in the margin of a line on the recto
% page, the line number of the corresponding line on the verso side, in
% square brackets.  You may mark that line number with a distinctive
% identifier.  |\synchroflag| is a token register to hold that
% identifier, and |\setsynchroflag| is a command to put the identifier
% in the register.  For instance, if you are setting the 1805 version of
% Wordsworth's \emph{The Prelude} on the verso, and the 1850 version on
% the recto, you might wish to set the ``synchroflag'' to ``1805'' so
% that the line cross reference will look something like ``[1805:
% 147]''.
%    \begin{macro}{\setsynchroflag}

% \subsection{~Finishing up} 
%    \begin{macro}{\finish}
% The  |\finish| macro  reads in the notes, 
% the index (previously created from your .aux file by MakeIndex), and 
% the contents sections and sets them. The notes sections send page 
% information to the contents file as they are set. Then the page 
% information for the index is sent to the contents file. Finally the 
% contents file is closed and read in. If you have an editor's 
% introduction or a list of abbreviations, copy this macro, uncomment out the commented out lines, 
% and issue it all as a |\renewcommand| for |\finish|. Be sure to 
% have the command |\label{editorsintroduction}| on the first page of 
% your introduction.

% It usually takes three 
% passes to get the table of contents and the index files correct. 
% 
% The consequence of doing using |\finish| is that the table of
% contents comes last.  There are ways around this that are described
% earlier.  The notes sections are all typeset in the |\small| size.

% \subsection{~Visual formatting} The ideal in \LaTeX\ is to separate 
% content markup and formatting as completely as possible. In the text 
% itself you simply mark the logical units (a poem, a title, a stanza, 
% a textual note), and a header program like this interprets the 
% meaning of those terms typographically. However, one still winds up 
% having to do some visual formatting. Sometimes you have to enlarge or 
% shrink a page by one line in order to avoid an intractable widow or 
% club line, and when one does so one must be careful to do the same to 
% the other member of the two-page spread of which that page is a part. 
% These commands enable one to wiggle pagelength enough to handle these 
% problems.
