This work is "author-maintained"

This work consists of this file toptesi.dtx, a README file
and the derived files:
 
toptesi.cls, toptesi.sty, topfront.sty, topcommand.sty,
toptesi.cfg, and the English documentation toptesi.pdf.
 
Furthermore the bundle contains the documentation source
file toptesi-it-pdftex.tex and the derived file 
toptesi-it-pdftex.pdf.

The toptesi-example.tex source file is just an example 
that shows how to use the various commands; by commenting 
or uncommenting certain source lines it is possible to 
typeset different kind of theses and their front pages.

The topfront-example.tex source file is an example of how 
to produce just the title page with TOPtesi and the external
package frontespizio.

The toptesi.cfg file is a sample of a local configuration 
file that can be copied to another file and its copy freely 
edited and customized.

By running pdflatex on toptesi.dtx the user gets the class, 
sty and cfg files and the English documentation file in
pdf format.

The source file of the Italian documentation file 
toptesi-it-pdftex.pdf is another example of how to use TOPtesi. 
In spite of its name, toptesi-it-pdftex.tex may be typeset 
with pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX, and LuaLateX; see the first comment 
lines of the file for how-to information.

% \begin{abstract}
% This file describes the TOPtesi bundle; it is a set of files designed to
% typeset  a university final report that in Italian is generally
% called ``tesi''; it was originally developed at the Technical University
% of Turin (Politecnico di Torino) but it was adapted for typesetting theses in any
% Italian university. Well\dots\ since the Erasmus student mobility is very
% extended and many Italian students participate in the so called \textit{double degree}
% programs, their theses, or whatever they are called in other countries,
% may be typeset so as to comply also with the host university rules; therefore this
% set of files has the ambition to be suited for typesetting theses in any university
% in the world\dots\ This ambition can't be fulfilled, though, because of the complexity
% of the title page (and possibly of the legal page) requirements. This version is
% experimentally compliant with the \XeLaTeX\ and the \LuaLaTeX\ programs. Up to now
% the few conflicts that have been spotted have been solved with suitable corrections
% or additions. The most important feature with \XeLaTeX\ is that the option pdfa
% cannot be used any more; this is due to the fact that
% the typesetting engine \XeTeX\ does not produce directly any PDF output but
% a modified, extended DVI output, that is immediately converted into a PDF file
% through xdvipdfmx, a special version of the conversion program. Another minor
% \XeLaTeX\ feature is that it cannot fully exploit the typesetting facilities
% of the microtype package, but the wide choice of OpenType fonts replaces almost
% completely such missing features.
% \end{abstract}
%
% \section{Introduction}
% The TOPtesi bundle contains a certain number of files.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item A class file \texttt{toptesi.cls} to be used as the main document class; the main
% document may be any of a certain number of reports that in Italy
% are called with various names: ``monografia'', ``monografia di laurea'',
% ``tesi di laurea'', ``tesi di laurea specialistica'', ``tesi di laurea
% magistrale'', ``tesi di dottorato'', ``dissertazione di dottorato'', and so on.
% All these documents have in common the fact that they all conclude a period of
% university education. Moreover since they may conclude a double degree university
% program, they may receive foreign names such as, for example, ``Projet de fin d'\'etudes'', ``Master thesis'', and the like.
% \item An extension package \texttt{toptesi.sty} that contains most of the code
% for the real typesetting; it might be used as an extension to other classes,
% although this use is seldom necessary.
% \item A second extension package \texttt{topfront.sty} that contains the
% commands and the typesetting macros for the title page; this file may be
% used as an independent extension package to be added to, say, the report
% class file for typesetting just the title page; this file might be used as
% a template for setting up the title page fixed information in languages
% different from Italian. This package is part of the bundle, but it is
% automatically loaded only if the user did not specify the class option
% |noTOPfront| or its alias |usefrontespizio|; if this option is specified
% the user is free to use whatever other external package s/he prefers in
% order to typeset the tile page; in this case we suggest to use the package
% |frontespizio| and we address the user to its documentation. It is important
% to recall that if the |topfront| package has to be loaded, is is only at
% the execution of the |\begin{document}| command. There fore no title page
% commands of any kind (those defined by |topfront|) can be used in the preamble.
% \item A third extension package \texttt{topcoman.sty} that defines a certain
% number of user commands suitable for typesetting technical matters.
% \item Previous versions of this bundle contained also the logos of a set of
% universities; these logos are not distributed anymore because of legal
% constraints. Every one who is working on his/her degree course final report
% must retrieve the logo of his/her university, but s/he should pay attention
% to use it according to the rules and limitations of the university.
% \item A documentation file \texttt{toptesi-it-xetex.pdf} written in Italian
% where every feature is explained in detail; essential information is given
% in this English documentation. The source file of the documentation
% \texttt{toptesi-it-xetex.tex} may be used as a sample or template for
% typesetting one's thesis with XeLaTeX.
% \end{enumerate}
%
% The above files are complemented with a configuration file that any user may
% customise at will; this customisation file makes it easy to configure the
% bundle so as to make it suitable for another language; in facts the
% \textsf{babel} and \textsf{polyglossia} packages contain localisations
% for many languages, but such localisations deal with the standard infix
% \LaTeX\ names and phrases and do not cope with the thesis title page requirements.
% This customisation is usable only if no |noTOPfront| or |usefrontespizio|
% option had been declared to the class.
%
% TOPtesi was specifically conceived for typesetting theses with the \LaTeX\ mark-up,
% and initially it was using the \textsf{tex} typesetting engine; later on this engine
% was substantially substituted by the \textsf{pdftex} one, which was capable
% of direct output of PDF files. Since about 2006 the typesetting engine \XeTeX\
% is available; the most important feature of this engine is its capability
% of using OpentType fonts, among which those that are available to the
% operating system of the specific platform where the document is being typeset.
% For what concerns theses this might be of essential importance when the thesis
% deals with specific languages that use different scripts (Greek, Russian,
% Bulgarian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hebrew, Arabic, Farsi, Thai, and so on).
%
% This version of TOPtesi has been tested with \XeLaTeX. Some conflicts have
% been spotted and solved; may be there are still hidden ones, so that feedback
% from users is particularly welcome. The only main drawback still present
% when running \XeLaTeX\ is the fact that this program cannot still
% \emph{directly} produce the output file in PDF format, although it
% automatically transforms its specific output file into PDF format. This
% implies that the specific \textsf{pdftex} features required to produce
% a PDF/A compliant output PDF file suitable for long term archiving cannot
% be used. But with some attention the PDF file output by \XeLaTeX\ may be
% converted to PDF/A by using the program \prog{ghostscript}.
%
% \section{User commands}
% The \texttt{toptesi.cls} is basically an extension of the standard class
% \texttt{report.cls}; it redefines the page typesetting grid, the headers
% and the footers, and the title page layout and commands. \texttt{toptesi.cls}
% does not set such crazy settings as ``double spaced'' text; it is intended
% to typeset the thesis with the quality of a \LaTeX\ well typeset document,
% not as a typewriter written one.
%
% Theses very often are full of specialised material: formulas, diagrams and pictures,
% texts written in non Latin alphabets, special symbols for philological mark-up, and
% the like; a common typewriter would not be suitable and the quality of the contents
% requires professional typesetting; this is why I strongly believe that instructions
% on typesetting styles that refer to the ``gone by times'' of mechanical typewriters
% should be banned.
%
% At the same time the class allows to typeset theses on any paper format;
% nowadays, in facts, Universities are requesting theses in smaller formats
% than A4 or letter paper. With smaller paper sizes the layout changes
% automatically, but the title page might require some more attention. The
% default paper size is A4, but the user can set any paper size among those
% accepted by the |report| standard class. If the |noTOPfront| option
% was specified and the package |frontepsizio| was loaded by the user, it
% is necessary to remind that it can easily create pretty nice title pages, but
% by default it is preset to use A4 paper where it can typeset the tytle page in
% two styles, one so called ``standard'' and the other called ``elements'', that
% mimics that of the famous book \emph{Elements of typographic style} by
% Robert Bringhurst; this is so at least with |frontespizio|'s version
% 1.4a of 2011/09/21 or earlier. It is possible to use |frontespizio| to use
% a different paper size, but it's necessary to make use of certain
% customisation commands described in its documentation.
%
% Therefore if you want to typeset your thesis while typesetting the title
% page by means of the functionalities of package |frontespizio| you have
% to follow carefully how to use that package's options in the proper way
% as to bypass the two fixed styles  it can produce. 
% See also the Italian documentation contained in the document |toptesi-it-xetex.pdf|.
%
% Most new commands refer themselves to the information that should be typeset
% in the title page; some class options specify special stylistic page details;
% the rest is simple and traditional \LaTeX\ mark-up as it is implemented in
% the \LaTeX\ kernel and in the report class. If \XeLaTeX\ has to be
% used, some essential preamble specific commands are to be used, but essentially
% the body of the thesis has the same mark-up.
%
% \subsection{Class options}
% The class accepts all the options accepted by the |report| document class
% plus the ones defined here:
% \begin{description}\def\Item[#1]{\item[\texttt{#1}]}
%
% \Item[chapterbib] Allows to typeset a list of references at the end
% of each chapter and the bibliography items are numbered with a \emph{chapter.item}
% indication. This implies a manual build up of each end-of-chapter bibliography
% by means off a specific |thebibliography| environment. This works may be
% avoided if the user relies on the various packages already available in any
% complete \TeX\ system distribution and the facilities offered by packages
% such as \pack{biblatex} and sorting end formatting engines such as \prog{biber}.
%
% \Item[classica] Specifies a general modification of certain details that are
% supposed to be  more adequate for theses in humanities; specifically this option
% lets old style numbers to be used for certain numerical pieces of information;
% some variations are also introduced in the title page.
%
% \Item[cucitura]  In two sided printing it is better to move the
% typesetting grid towards the outer edges so as to cope with the thesis binding
% that is generally not made up by sewing together a number of signatures;
% the default outer displacement is fixed to~7mm, but it can be customised by means
% of a proper entry in the configuration file or by an explicit command in the preamble.
%
% \Item[14pt] Extends the normal size choice to 14 points; it is appreciated
% in various fields of humanities, but I would discourage this use in a technical
% thesis, where 10 point perhaps is too small, but 11 point or 12 point typesetting
% may be adequate. 
%
% \Item[autoretitolo] This option modifies the left hand (even numbered) pages
% in two side typesetting; normally the even numbered page headings contain
% the chapter title, while the odd numbered ones contain the current section title.
% If the \texttt{classica} option has been specified, then with this option it is
% possible to have even numbered headings contain the author's name and the thesis
% title, while the odd numbered ones contain the chapter title. Since the thesis
% title might be too long to fit in the header together with the author's name,
% the |\title| macro as been modified so as to accept an optional short title,
% similarly to the ordinary sectioning commands.
%
% \Item[oldstyle] Also this option works only if \texttt{classica} had already been
% specified; it typesets several numerical data with the old style numbers.
% 
% \Item[noTOPfront] allows the user to load a different package for
% creating and typesetting the title page; of course if this option is
% specified, the native package |topfront| is not loaded, and the commands
% described in the next section are not available. On the opposite, commands available
% with the chosen package become available, while possible package conflicts are
% eliminated at the root.
%
% \Item[usefrontespizio] is basically equivalent to the previous option; both
% options set up the |\ifTOPfront| switch that is more mnemonic than the long
% (actually not defined) |\iffrontespizio| one; if it was defined, |\iffrontespizio|
% would be true when |\ifTOPfront| is false.
% \end{description}
%
% \subsection{Title page commands}
% Note: Skip this section if you decide to load an external package for
% the title~page. Notice also that if you want to load an external package for
% typesetting the title page, you should load it \emph{after} specifying
% the input encoding you use for your text files.\bigskip
%
% \noindent The user must specify a certain number of commands in order to have the
% title page contain all the required information. It must be specified that
% most of these commands may be used in the configuration file so as to avoid repeating
% the same data for different ``final reports''; well, a university student might write a
% bachelor's  ``monografia'', then a master thesis and finally a doctoral dissertation;
% why should s/he repeat his/her name, the name of the institution, and so on?
%
% All the user commands for the title page redefine default values or strings;
% therefore if none of the required information is given, the default values and strings
% are typeset, possibly with hilarious results\dots
%
% Since most users are supposed to be Italian, the user commands are mostly in Italian;
% the following description gives their names and meanings; every command receives one
% argument; only the command |\title| accepts an optional argument according to the usual
% \LaTeX\ syntax:
% \[
%   \makebox[0pt]{%
%       \texttt{\char92}\emph{command}\relax
%                   \texttt{[}\emph{opt\_arg}\texttt{]}\relax
%                   \texttt{\char123}\emph{req\_arg}\texttt{\char125}\relax
%               }
% \]
% \begin{description}
% \def\cs#1{\texttt{\char92#1}}
% \def\Item[#1]{\item[\normalfont\cs{#1}]}
% \item[\textnormal{\ttfamily fontespizio}] and \texttt{frontespizio*} are two
% environments that typeset the title page with two opposite styles: with the
% university logo in the header vs the university logo in the lower part of
% the front page. The commands described in the following items shall be used
% either in the configuration file or within the body of these environments.
%^^A
% \Item[frontespizio] {\tolerance=6000 Even if the above environments are
% recommended, the
% command |\frontespizio|, defined in the previous versions of the TOPtesi
% bundle, is still usable. It typesets the title page according to the actual
% status of the boolean |\topTPTlogos|; the user, before issuing the
% |\frontespizio| command, may set this boolean by means of the |\topTPTlogostrue|
% or |\topTPTlogosfalse|, or with either one of the commands
% |\booltrue{topTPTlogos}| and |\boolfalse{topTPTlogos}|.\par}
%^^A
% \Item[monografia]  sets the bachelor's report style and retrieves its title
% \Item[titolo]  gets the master or PhD thesis title and an optional thesis short title
% \Item[sottotitolo]  gets the thesis subtitle if any
% \Item[materia]  gets the name of the subject the thesis deals with
% \Item[Materia]  alias for \cs{materia}
% \Item[direttore]  gets the name of the Doctoral School Director
% \Item[coordinatore]  gets the name of the Doctoral School Coordinator
% \Item[QualificaDirettore]  gets the phrase that describes the director or coordinator
%                 official position; by using the command \cs{direttore} the
%                 default phrase
%                 ``Direttore della Scuola di Dottorato'' is printed above the 
%                 ``director's'' name;
%                 if \cs{coordinatore} is used the default phrase ``Coordinatore della
%                 Scuola di Dottorato'' is printed instead.
%                 If neither one is applicable or a description 
%                 in another language is required, this macro is available for
%                 specifying such position.
% \Item[relatore]  gets the name of the thesis first supervisor
% \Item[secondorelatore]  gets the name of the second supervisor
% \Item[terzorelatore]  gets the name of the third supervisor; it is assumed that the
%                 number of supervisors never exceeds three.
% \Item[tutore]  gets the name of the doctorate tutor; there is no difference
%                with regards to the \cs{relatore}, but the default phrase
%                ``Tutore'' is printed above this person's name.
% \Item[TutorName]  gets the phrase that describes the tutor position, possibly
%                 in a different language.
% \Item[AdvisorName] gets the string that qualifies the supervisor(s); the default string
%                   is ``Relatore:'' or ``Relatori:'' for the plural;
%                   in another language this command is used to define the string,
%                   say, ``Supervisors:'' if the thesis has been supervised
%                   by more than one person.
% \Item[CoAdvisorName] gets the string that qualifies the co-supervisor(s); the default
%                   string is ``Correlatore:'' or ``Correlatori:'' in the plural; this
%                   command may be used to define the string, say, ``Corapporteur:'' in a
%                   French Projet de fin d'\'etudes.
% \Item[candidato]  gets the name of the male author
% \Item[candidata]  gets the name of the female author
% \Item[secondocandidato]  gets the name of the second male author
% \Item[secondacandidata]  gets the name of the second female author
% \Item[terzocandidato]  gets the name of the third male author
% \Item[terzacandidata]  gets the name of the third female author; most often the thesis
%                 author is just one person; but there are some institutions where group
%                 final works are accepted; it is assumed that the group does not contain 
%                 more than three authors. The specification of the gender allows the
%                 software to determine the correct labelling phrase in the proper
%                 gender and proper number.
%                 For different languages there might be no difference in gender but
%                 there is a difference in the plural ending.
% \Item[CandidateName]  gets the string that describes the student status in a foreign
%                 language or even in Italian; the default string is ``Candidato:'' (with
%                 colons) adjusted to masculine or feminine, singular or plural; with the
%                 option \texttt{classica} the string becomes ``Laureando:''; in other
%                 languages it is necessary to specify this string in the proper gender
%                 and number.
% \Item[sedutadilaurea] gets the date of the final exam, or presentation, or defence
%                 of the thesis; if this date is omitted the default date is the current
%                 month and year in Italian.
% \Item[esamedidottorato] an alias for \cs{sedutadilaurea} to be used for doctoral
%                 dissertations.
% \Item[ciclodidottorato]  gets the roman numeral that specifies the doctoral cycle.
% \Item[CycleName]  redefines the string that expresses the name of the doctoral cycle;
%                 by default this is ``ciclo'' but this command is useful to set the
%                 name in a different language.
% \Item[corsodilaurea] gets the proper name of the degree course; the phrase that
%                 describes the degree course is specified, if necessary, with the
%                 next command; with this one you specify just, say,
%                 ``Electrical Engineering''
% \Item[CorsoDiLaureaIn]  gets the generic name of the degree course, for example
%                 ``Bachelor Degree in\textvisiblespace''
% \Item[TesiDiLaurea] gets the generic phrase that describes the thesis; by default it is
%                 ``Tesi di Laurea''; in English one might set it to ``Master Thesis''.
% \Item[NomeMonografia]  gets the phrase that describes the bachelor's report; by default
%                 it is ``Monografia di Laurea''. In some Italian universities it might
%                 be called ``Tesi di Laurea'', so that the master thesis should be given
%                 another qualification, for example ``Tesi di Laurea Magistrale''.
% \Item[NomeDissertazione]  gets the phrase that describes the doctoral thesis;
%                 by default it is ``Tesi di Dottorato''.
% \Item[InName]  infix strings often require adjusting of the prepositions; this macro
%                gets the preposition that stands for ``in'' (the default). In German
%                it might become ``auf''.
% \Item[NomeAnnoAccademico] defines the infix string that stands for ``Academic year''.
%                 This macro is defined only if the option \texttt{classica} is in force;
%                 after all the command |\annoaccademico| is defined only with that
%                 option.
% \Item[logosede] specifies the name of the file or the files that contain the university
%                 logos; no  default is defined; rather a warning message is issued if no
%                 name is given or the file is missing, but typesetting goes on without
%                 the inclusion of any logo. A list of logos can be specified, useful
%                 when a thesis is carried on in a multiple University environment
%                 such as, for example, in a double degree Erasmus
%                 program; or under the Erasmus Mundus program. The ``string'' of
%                 logos is scaled properly so that they may fit in |\textwidth|.
% \Item[setbindingcorrection] sets up the length to displace the text block to the
%                 external margin so as to have a wider internal margin to accommodate
%                 the binding correction. Its argument is not optional and is used to
%                 modify the default correction of 7\,mm. Notice that 7\,mm is already
%                 a large displacement; most often than not the binding correction is
%                 unnecessary.
% \Item[retrofrontespizio] with its argument, made up of one or several paragraphs,
%                 defines what should be printed on the verso of the title page,
%                 generally named ``copyright page''; if this command is specified
%                 with an empty text or if it is not used at all, no copyright
%                 page is assumed.
% \end{description}
%
% Since the infix strings are all memorised into control sequences and for each of
% them it is possible to use a defining command, all strings can be modified at will,
% so that there is no difficulty to localise the package in another language;
% this comes particularly handy for the Erasmus students on double degree programs.
%
% As a final remark notice that the commands for typesetting the title page and the
% copyright page are contained in the package \texttt{topfront.sty}, which can be used
% as an autonomous extension to the \texttt{report} document class. One could easily
% typeset either just the title page with a separate \TeX\ source file so as to test the
% completeness of the commands and coherence of the configuration file, or for just
% printing the isolated title and copyright pages (if any).
%
% \subsection{Typesetting commands}
% The TOPtesi bundle and the |toptesi| document class accept all \LaTeX\ commands
%  provided by the \LaTeX\ \texttt{kernel}, the \texttt{report} document class, and the
% \texttt{graphicx} extension package, besides those provided by the \texttt{babel}
% package.
% If the source thesis file is being typeset by means of \XeLaTeX\ the \texttt{babel}
% package is not loaded; in its place the \texttt{polyglossia} package is loaded that
% should implement in \XeLaTeX\ most of the functionality provided by \texttt{babel} in
% \LaTeX. ``Most'' means that not all the functionality is available, therefore it's
% better to consult the documentation of \texttt{polyglossia} before using its built
% in commands.
%
% With this respect it must be underlined that the Italian and English languages are
% specified by default, the Italian one being the main language. An initial
% specification of |\selectlanguage{english}| sets the English language as the default.
% Should a student typeset the thesis in French by means of \textsf{pdflatex}, it
% would be necessary to specify the option \texttt{french} among the \emph{class}
% options, and then start the document by specifying |\selectlanguage{french}|.
% But the user should pay attention to use \texttt{babel} in the proper way.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Due to the way \LaTeX\ classes load the requested files, and to the fact that the
% \texttt{babel} package has already been loaded by the \texttt{toptesi} class, the user
% cannot reload it with a different list of language options; therefore the latter
% language options \emph{must be specified} as a global class options; so if the
% thesis has to be typeset, for example, in French, is is necessary to do the following:
%\begin{verbatim}
%\documentclass[...,french,...]{toptesi}
%...
%\begin{document}
%\selectlanguage{french}
%\end{verbatim}
% But if the thesis should be typeset in French by means of \XeLaTeX, then it is
% perfectly legal to specify the auxiliary language in this way:
%\begin{verbatim}
%\documentclass[...]{toptesi}
%\setotherlanguage{french}
%...
%\begin{document}
%\selectlanguage{french}
%\end{verbatim}
% \item With the 2010 \TeX\ system complete distributions, both \TeX Live and MiKTeX,
% all known (to \LaTeX) language hyphenation rules are preloaded; with other less up
% to date \TeX\ system distributions this might not be true. With both distributions
% also the language hyphenation rules known to \XeLaTeX\ are all preloaded.
% Remember that \texttt{babel} and \texttt{polyglossia} macros select the language
% typesetting rules, but hyphenation is activated only if the program format file has
% been generated with the pertinent language hyphenation rules. You can check this
% detail by reading the first dozen lines of your thesis \texttt{.log} file; there 
% the list of all language hyphenation rules that are available in the format file is
% being shown.
% While (American) English is the default language and almost any \emph{basic}
% distribution of the \TeX\ system has several preloaded languages, it is more
% likely that French is preloaded while Italian is not. Complete distributions don't
% exhibit this flaw.
%
% Should the required language(s) be missing, the user is forced to read his/her
% distribution instructions, so as to find out how to configure his/her system in
% order to preload the languages s/he wants to work with, and finally s/he must
% recreate the format files.
% The user is invited to carefully investigate on these fine points and to properly
% configure the system; it would be very upsetting to use fine software for producing a
% perfectly typeset thesis that, unfortunately, has wrong hyphenation points! Luckily
% enough, recent distributions of the \TeX\ system have all the known hyphenation rules
% preloaded; in any case even older distributions have available command-line commands
% or graphical user interfaces that make it easy to perform the tasks of changing the
% list of preloaded hyphenation rules and rebuilding all the format files, moving them
% to the proper places.
% \end{enumerate}
%
% The TOPtesi bundle adds very little to the user commands; nevertheless the package
% \texttt{topcoman.sty}, that is part of this bundle and is automatically loaded, defines
% some useful commands for typesetting technical matters in such a way as to fulfil the
% ISO regulations.
% Some of these commands are already defined with the \texttt{babel} Italian option,
% but if your thesis is written in different languages it may happen that such
% commands are not available any more when you select another language; with the
% presence of the definitions contained in \texttt{topcoman.sty} such useful commands
% remain available with every language. The \texttt{polyglossia} package does not
% produce any useful additional command for writing in a ISO compliant way, therefore
% the macros contained in the \texttt{topcoman.sty} package come very handy.
%
% The following description specifies these particular commands.
% \begin{description}
% \def\Item[#1]{\item[\normalfont\texttt{\char92#1}]}
% \Item[DeclareSlantedCapitalGreekLetters] does exactly what its name
% means: it changes the definitions of the mathematical capital Greek letters so that
% they are typeset in ``italics''; they are in effects taken from the math
% italic alphabet, instead of the default roman one. This option is useful with \LaTeX,
% while with \XeLaTeX\ it is unnecessary due to the larger set of math alphabets and math
% font commands that are available with proper UNICODE math fonts.
% %
% \Item[ensuremath] should be already defined in the \LaTeX\ kernel;
% should one still be using an obsolete version, this command gets
% available anyhow.
% %
% \Item[ohm] typesets an upright capital omega even if the capital Greek
% letters are in italics; another good point is that |\ohm| can be used also
% in text mode.
% %
% \Item[ped] inserts a subscript in upright type; the ISO regulations
% require the use of italics for physical or mathematical quantities, and
% upright type for anything that is not a variable, from the names of
% functions (such as sin, cos, log, etc.), to the indices that contain
% information on something that is not variable. This means that $V_i$
% requires an italic index to imply that the object $V$ is the $i$-th in
% a set, while, say, $V_{\mathrm{max}}$ indicates the maximum value of the
% variable $V$. This command |\ped| may be used  in both math and text mode.
% %
% \Item[ap] similarly |\ap| inserts an apex in upright type, in both math
% and text mode.
% %
% \Item[unit] sets the unit of measure close to the numerical measure value by
% inserting a non breakable thin space and by setting the units of
% measure in upright type; this works both in math and text mode. Of
% course it is necessary to input the |\unit| command without intervening
% spaces in the source file; it's necessary to typeset, say,
% |35\unit{km}| and to avoid writing \verb*+35 \unit{km}+. This command,
% as it is defined, conflicts with the definition of the homonymous
% command |\unit| as defined by the \texttt{unitsx} package, but since
% this latter package is necessarily input in the preamble, while
% \texttt{topcomand.sty} is read at the execution of |\begin{document}|,
% the latter file ha provisions to test if |unitsx| has already been loaded,
% so as not to overwrite the latter package definition and to avoid every
% possible conflict.
% %
% \Item[micro] sets the decimal prefix $\mu$ when typesetting units of
% measure.
% %
% \Item[gradi] sets the small circle that defines the sexagesimal degrees, for
% example $35^\circ$; it may be used also for the celsius degrees by writing in the
% source file, say, |35\unit{\gradi C}| in order to get
% $35\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$; notice the difference with |35\gradi|, that yields
% $35^\circ$ without any space between the measure and the ``degree'' little
% circle; this is what the ISO regulations require; The small space inserted
% by |\unit| is required when the unit of measure symbol contains at least
% one letter.
% %
% \Item[gei] inserts the imaginary unit in upright type with the
% ``spelling'' used by the technologists: ``j''. This command may be
% redefined, of course, but this strange name is due to the fact that
% nowadays the letter ``j'' in Italian is called with the English name
% (much shorter than the traditional Italian name ``i~lunga'') and the
% indicated spelling ``gei'' is the phonetic Italian rendering of the
% English word. The imaginary unit is not a variable, and the ISO regulations
% require it is typed with an upright serifed font, just as operators are.
% %
% \Item[eu] inserts the Napier number symbol ``e'' in upright type; since
% this entity is not a variable, but it is a mathematical constant, the ISO
% regulations require it to be written in upright type. The ISO regulations
% require the upright type for ``e'' and any other mathematical constant, but
% the electron charge $e$ is typeset in math italics because this is physical
% ``constant'', not a mathematical one. \XeTeX\ allows to typeset upright
% math Greek letters,  so there is the facility to typeset an upright ``pi''
% (the number) to be distinguished  from an slanted ''pi'' (the angle).
% %
% \Item[goodpagebreak] inserts a conditional page break in after the line
% where this command appears; it is not equivalent to the |\raggedbottom|
% declaration that does not vertically justify any page, but tests the
% amount of space remaining on the page, and if less than a given number of
% lines are available inserts a page break; the result is a ragged bottom
% single page, that sometimes is better than loose spacing between paragraphs,
% or within items of a list, or before or after displayed material. It is
% handy also to use before starting a new section, because at least four
% lines are required by \LaTeX\ in order to avoid orphan lines.
%
% \Item[listing] requires for its argument the name of a file and typesets
% it in verbatim mode; this command is very useful for typesetting the
% listings of the programs that were written for the thesis; for best results
% it is recommended that the source program has lines not longer than
% 80 characters. There exists an external package \texttt{listings}, that
% the user might want to load, that does a similar work in a more professional
% and configurable way; this package simpler command might be preferable for
% its simplicity, but of course it is not compulsory.
% \end{description}
%
% All these commands are defined into the separate package \texttt{topcoman.sty}
% that might be used as an independent extension package with any document class.
%
% \section{PDF/A archivable format}
% This section in general applies also if the thesis is typeset by means
% of \XeLaTeX, but in this case  special attention should be given to the
% details of the procedure as described in the documentation of the
% \pack{pdfx} package. Even better, \LuaLaTeX, whose source file is
% practically the same as that of \XeLaTeX, may produce in a simpler way
% a PDF/A compliant output file if the users follow attentively the
% instructions contained in the documentation of the \pack{pdfx} package.
%
% More details are given in the Italian documentation contained in files
% \texttt{toptesi\discretionary{-}{}{-}it-pdftex}.
%
% Politecnico di Torino as well as many other Italian and foreign universities
% are moving towards archiving theses in electronic format, specifically in the
% PDF one. The problem of course is: ``Will it be possible to read the archived
% documents, say, fifty years from now?''
%
% This essential question has been answered by the International Standards
% Organisation (ISO) that in 2005 published the regulation ISO~19005-1. This
% regulation defines a PDF variant suitable for archiving, named PDF/A, that
% has two sub-formats distinguished as PDF/A-1a, and PDF/A-1b. The `a'
% sub-format is more exacting, while the `b' one is less stringent. Recently
% ISO has published  upgrades to these regulations, but here we stick to the
% older ones, that are a sub set of the newer ones, and for which suitable
% software is available.
%
% The requirements for the `a' sub-format imply not only those imposed on
% the `b' one, but also that the logical structure of the document be
% accessible from outside (Tagged PDF).
% The requirements for the `b' sub-format are that the
% document must be reproducible without modifications exactly as it was at
% the moment of archiving. Both sub-formats must contain \emph{metadata}
% that are searchable even without decompressing the normally compressed
% PDF file, and that contain information useful for archive maintenance;
% among these informations, of course, the PDF/A category the document belongs
% to, the document title, the authors, and few other optional pieces of
% information, such as the keywords that ease up library searches.
%
% Since version 1.40, the program \texttt{pdflatex} is capable of producing
% PDF/A-1b compliant files, provided that some attention is put into 
% editing of the source file of the thesis. With the distribution of
% the 2008 version of the \TeX\ system, the executable \texttt{pdflatex} has
% version number 1.40.9 (or higher) and is capable of producing PDF/A-1b files.
%
% The particular attention needed to avoid problems with the PDF/A compliance
% is summarised as follows:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item The preliminary essential requirement is that the \texttt{pdflatex}
%   engine used to typeset the thesis be sufficiently recent to support the
%   PDF/A requirements. It's better to have the most recent distribution of
%   the \TeX\ system installed on your PC. Do not try to typeset the thesis
%   with the `old' \LaTeX; you \emph{must} process the input thesis file(s)
%   with \texttt{pdflatex} or with \prog{xelatex} or with \prog{lualatex};
%   in the following, no specific check will be made in order to verify if
%   you are actually using \texttt{pdflatex}. If you really need to use the
%  `old' \LaTeX, you get a DVI file and you need to transform it with |dvips|
%   into a PS file; at this point you have lost the possibility of exploiting
%   the internal commands of |pdflatex| version 1.40.9 or later. You can still
%   produce a PDF/A final document, but you have to transform it by means of
%   |ghostscript|; read the |ghostscript| (version 9.16 or later) documentation
%   file |ps2pdf.html| in order to find out how to produce the correct
%   PS-to-PDF/A transformation. The documentation in
%   Italian describes several more or less effective methods to transform
%   a non compliant PDF/A file into a compliant one, and how to correct the
% ``imperfections'' that forbid any valid transformation.
%
% \item As said before, \prog{lualatex} used to be partially compatible
%   with package \pack{pdfx}, because in spite of having a typesetting
%   engine that has a strong resemblance with \prog{pdftex} it did not
%   contain all its primitives; therefore it was necessary to load other
%   packages e create some little patches. Since 2016 the TeXLive
%   distribution contains a new version of \pack{pdfx} and now PDF documents
%   produced with \prog{lualatex} may be fully compatible with the standard
%   PDF/A. With some special care, even \prog{xelatex} can now produce PDF/A
%   compliant output files.
%
% \item Your up-to-date complete \TeX\ distribution should contain the package
%   \textsf{pdfx}; if it does not, upgrade your \TeX\ system complete
%   distribution. Be sure that the version number of the \pack{pdfx} package
%   has version number 1.5.8 or higher.
% 
% \item If your thesis main file, the one you run your \texttt{pdflatex} on,
%   is named, say, \texttt{JohnSmithMasterThesis.tex}, prepare in the same
%   directory another file named \texttt{JohnSmithMasterThesis.xmpdata} that
%   contains the \emph{metadata} relative to the thesis; pay attention to
%   follow the stringent syntax described and exemplified in the \textsf{pdfx}
%   documentation. A minimal set of \emph{metadata} example would be the
%   following one:
% \begin{verbatim}
% \Title{Experiments in Trichotetratomy}
% \Author{John Smith}
% \end{verbatim}
%   The keyword list requires a specific format that can be examined
%   in the package documentation. The best way to be sure that this file
%   accompanies the thesis main file, is to put its contents in a
%   \env{filecontents*} environment before the |\documentclass| declaration.
%   The details are in the documentation of the \pack{pdfx} package.
%
% \item Some mathematical symbol commands obtained from the standard \LaTeX\
%   set-up and the standard mathematical fonts require some patching that is
%   already included in this \texttt{TOPtesi} bundle; but it is not excluded
%   that with other fonts similar patches might be requested. The UNICODE
%   math fonts used by \XeLaTeX\ and \LuaLaTeX\ do not require any patch.
%
% \item Use only PNG and JPEG images with RGB color profiles. If a PNG image
%   file contains some transparencies, the document PDF cannot be validated
%   as PDF/A compliant.
%
% \item If you include PDF images that contain some text, be sure that the
%   fonts for this text are completely embedded in the included file. Should
%   the PDF file come from an external drawing program be sure to configure
%   that program so that it embeds all the fonts used in the image. If you
%   don't succeed, open the PDF file with the free program \texttt{inkscape}
%   and save it back in PDF format; the missing fonts will be replaced with
%   their traced outlines and this will not disturb the PDF/A conformity. Pay
%   attention, because Inkscape might save your file with some specifications
%   for transparency; transparency specification destroy the PDF/A compliance.
%
% \item Verify your final PDF file with a suitable program and do not give
%   up doing the necessary corrections or modifications while the verification
%   program keeps saying that this or that is not compliant  with the PDF/A
%   specification. A suitable program is the Preflight module of Adobe Acrobat
%   Pro~XI, but this, although the most authoritative, is a commercial program;
%   probably your university has special facilities for this task.
%
%\end{enumerate}
%
% Warning: if you are using Adobe Reader X (or later), this program will open
% a PDF file beginning with an information header stating that the file 
% PDF/A claims to be compliant; maybe it's true, but do not trust this
% information too much, at least don't believe that this information is a
% ``certification'' of the PDF/A compliance. I have seen files with this
% comforting information that did not pass the Preflight test!
%
% Up to today the realisation of PDF/A conforming files sets forth several
% problems that are of great concern for the large Institutions that have
% thousands of documents a year to archive; it is not a question implied
% in the free nature of the \prog{pdflatex}, \prog{xelatex}, and \prog{lualatex}
% programs, that, on the opposite, according to my experience have a very high
% rate of success in producing PDF/A compliant documents.  If you stick to the
% default \TeX\ system Type~1, 256-glyph fonts, or to the UNICODE encoded otf
% or ttf fonts and use this version of \texttt{TOPtesi} you should be able
% to avoid most problems.

% \section{Documented code}
% \subsection{The class code}
%
% Here begins the usual machinery for stating the required \TeX\ format
% and for sharing some code between the driver and the class part of the code, since they are
% supposed to carry the same date and version number, besides the description string.
% \iffalse
%<*class>
% \fi
%
% The class itself is very simple since it requires just the \texttt{report}
% document class and some packages with some default options. All options
% specified for the \texttt{toptesi} class are passed on to the \texttt{report}
% class; the |a4paper| option is made the default, but the user can call the
% class with any valid \LaTeX\ paper size. According to the \LaTeX\ machinery
% of option passing, the |\ExecuteOption| command assures that |a4paper|
% is the default size, but it is not being used if another paper size code is
% specified to the class. The same holds true for the other class options,
% except for the encoding code string because their passing machinery does
% not hold true for the \pack{inputenc} package; therefore this package is
% not loaded any more as it was in previous versions of the class\footnote{Thanks
% to Enrico Gregorio who pointed out this feature.}. On the opposite if another
% language is specified in the list of \pack{toptesi} class options, this
% language would be appended to the \pack{babel} package default options and,
% beware!, it would become the default language.

% \subsection{The \texttt{toptesi.sty} code}
% The greatest part of the \texttt{toptesi} class code is saved into a separate
% file partly for backward compatibility reasons (before version 3.x
% \texttt{toptesi} was just an extension to the \texttt{report} class) and
% partly because it might be used as a stand alone package, although, take
% notice, it might create some conflicts with with the \texttt{book} class code
% (although with the latest versions of |toptesi| we did not notice any conflict)
% while certainly it is incompatible with the \texttt{article} class. This
% package must contain its own \TeX\ format declaration and might have different
% version and subversion numbers compared to the class file and the other invoked
% packages that are part of the same bundle.

% We start with defining the debugging macros; these trace commands and macros

%
% Now we define the specific package options: \texttt{classica} and
% \texttt{trieste} are identical; the use of \texttt{trieste} is discouraged,
% but this option is maintained for backward compatibility.
% The option \texttt{14pt} is for choosing a normal size of 14pt; the class option
% file \texttt{size14.clo} is distributed with the \pack{extsizes} package and
% is already included in any complete distribution of the major \TeX\ system ones;
% in previous versions of this bundle there was a specific option class file for
% this large size, but with the latest complete distributions available, there
% is no chance that the existing option file is missing.
%
% \texttt{chapterbib} allows to set a list of references at the end of each
% chapter.

% that keep the left and the right marks; we define a box so as to set the
% headers inside this box; we redefine also the plain page styles; it is actually
% a leftover from the previous versions when the page number was set at the foot
% in bold face, but we leave it here without the bold face specification, so that
% in future versions folios may be redefined in a common way with the other page
% styles. Notice that in all page styles folios are always in the footers.
% By defining |\lapagina| to be equivalent to |\thepage| we can later on
% redefine |\lapagina| the way we like; we actually do so with the option

% These geometrical parameters are critical and everybody has his/her own

% these parameters work quite well but I would not suggest them for every
% kind of typewritten document.
% In particular the zero value for the text fraction appears strange, but
% students have the tendency to create large figures (more than large
% tables) and these tend to clog the figures queue. A 100\% space for the
% top of page figures and a requirement of 0\% text allows large floats

% One command that the default definition does not satisfy me very much is
% the |\caption| command; Of course it is possible to configure the caption
% styles by means of the \pack{caption} package and its handy set of option
% styles specified by means of the \textit{key$=$value} syntax; but if this
% package is not used, then it is convenient to redefine the internal
% |\@makecaption| macro that performs the job as explained hereafter.
% The issue is that I prefer a narrower justified caption rather than a
% caption where the last line is just a short word or the right segment
% of an hyphenated last word. If one sets the |\finalhyphendemerits|
% parameter to an incredibly high value, one might succeed in avoiding
% hyphenation in the last word of a caption, but this might lead to a very
% loose typesetting of the caption paragraph, especially if the horizontal
% box that contains it hardly exceeds the caption width. I initially set
% the caption width (a new length) to the overall text width diminished
% by 3em; then if the caption text, inclusive of the caption type string
% and number, is shorter than the text width it is typeset as centred text;
% if it exceeds the text width it is set as a justified paragraph whose
% line width equals the established caption width; but in any case the last
% line of the paragraph is measured and if it is shorter than one third
% of the caption width, this width is shortened a little bit and the
% paragraph is set again with this shortened caption width; in order to be sure
% that one iteration is sufficient, the caption width shrinking must be computed
% according to the number of lines the paragraph occupies.
%
% In order to count the number of lines the caption paragraph occupies it is
% necessary to recall that the first line occupies a vertical space that equals
% |\topskip| while the other lines occupy a vertical space equal to
% |\baselineskip|; the latter one is generally larger than |\topskip| therefore
% the integer division of the height of the vertical box divided by the
% |\baselineskip| is truncated to count a line less than the true value.
% In our case if the caption does not stay in one line, its text is typeset in a
% vertical box with a line spread of 0.95 so as to make the caption a little
% more compact than the regular text.
% The baseline skip is a little shorter than the regular one, but it should
% still exceed the default |\topskip|; when we first typeset the caption in a
% vertical box we strip off the last line and we must remember the presence
% of this line in our arithmetics.
%
% If the length of the stripped last line is longer that one third of the
% caption width, then the vertical box is recomposed by re\-stacking the
% individual lines, but if this last line is shorter than one third of the
% caption width, this width is recomputed in this way: let $N-1$ be the number
% of lines obtained with the integer division, i.e.\ one line less than those
% actually contained in the vertical box. Let $x$ be the initial caption
% width and $x_2$ the last line width; let $y$ be the new caption width; then
% the total length of the caption of width $x$ is $Nx+x_2$ and this should be
% distributed over $N+1$ lines; if we obtained the new caption width $y$ by
% dividing the total length by $N+1$ we should be able to typeset the whole
% caption with all the lines of equal length. This does not actually take 
% place because the new lines do not necessarily contain the same amount of
% inter word space, some words might have been hyphenated in a different
% way, and so on.
% Moreover we do not want a caption that barely exceeds the length of
% |\captionwidth| to be retyped into a two line caption width that is about
% one half of the width of the other captions.
% Therefore we allow for some white space in the last line by computing the
% new caption width with the following formula
% \[ y=\frac{(N+0.5)x + x_2}{N+1} \]
% By the way, if the package \pack{caption} has been loaded in the preamble,
% the specific definition of this bundle is not defined at all; it is
% necessary to delay this definition  at |\AtBeginDocument| so we are sure
% that that the package has been or has not been loaded. Of course
% if the \pack{caption} package has not been loaded the  |\captionsetup| macro
% is not defined and its use (for example, as a left over of some experiments
% with the \pack{caption} package) would produce an error for this reason we
% define it as a gobbling macro so as to neutralise its presence.

% These last heterogeneous definitions are partly important and partly residues of

% end of files. It's a long time that such DOS version is not being used, but some
% old time files might still be around.
%
% The cryptic code that redefines the comma in math mode establishes that this
% character is a normal math character, instead of a math punctuation mark. Actually the
% code that defines the mathematical active comma is a new addition that lets the comma
% perform correctly in its double function (decimal separator and punctuation mark). The
% only point where this code fails is when a list of numbers is typeset: when a numeric
% list must be typeset, such as, for example, $\forall i=0,\,1,\,2,\,3, n$, in the
% source code a space \emph{must} be inserted after every punctuating comma while no
% space follows a decimal comma: for example \verb*+$\forall i=0, 1, 2, 3,n$+.  
% The space before the |n| is not necessary (but it wouldn't hurt) because |n| is not
% recognised as a digit, therefore the ``intelligent'' comma inserts the necessary

% The TOPtesi bundle contains two new chapter like sections activated with
% the commands |\sommario| and |\ringraziamenti| respectively. The infix strings
% that start these sections depend on the used language.
%
% Because of this it is necessary to extend the list of infix string definitions
% provided the |\captions|$\langle$\texttt{language}$\rangle$ macros defined by
% the language description files of \texttt{babel} or of \texttt{polyglossia};
% for this purpose we define a macro for adding new items for these two new
% sectioning commands. This macro receives three arguments: the first is the babel
% language name, the second is the string for the summary name, and finally the
% third is the string for the acknowledgements name; everything is contained within
% a group and only the relevant captions macro is globally redefined. The token
% register `0' is normally for scratch usage, but the fact that its value is
% restored upon exiting the group provides the necessary protection against an
% involuntary reassignment to this register. At the same time if a specific
% language option was not specified, a warning message is issued, but compilation
% goes on any way without the sectioning string names. For being sure no other
% undefined error messages are issued, the |\summaryname| and |\acknowledgename|
% are let to |\empty|.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\providecommand*\summaryname{}

%    \end{macrocode}
% For Italian and English there are no problems; we provide immediately these extensions
% by means of the newly available macro:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\ExtendCaptions{italian}{Sommario}{Ringraziamenti}
\ExtendCaptions{english}{Summary}{Acknowledgements}
%    \end{macrocode}
% In facts the \texttt{babel} options for Italian and English have already been loaded by
% default; therefore both caption macros |\captionsitalian| and |\captionsenglish| are
% already defined and can be freely extended. For any other language the corresponding
% language option must be entered in the class opening statement, otherwise a warning
% is issued but compilation is not stopped. Therefore if, for example, the user wants
% to write the thesis in Spanish, the thesis main file shall start like this:
% \begin{verbatim}
% \documentclass[...,spanish]{toptesi}
% \ExtendCaptions{spanish}{Resumen}{Agradecimientos}
% ...
% \begin{document}
% \selectlanguahe{spanish}
% ...
% \end{verbatim}
% and the rest of the thesis will be typeset correctly in Spanish. Remember
% that Italian is the main language and nothing is necessary to set up
% the Italian defaults. If English is desired, then after |\begin{document}| is
% is necessary to specify the default language; for ease of use the following
% macros are defined so they can be used instead of the lengthy \texttt{babel}
% command; after the beginning of the document it is then possible to specify
% |\inglese| or |\english|, and the default language turns into English.
% These shorthand commands can be alternated so as to switch from one language
% to the other; nevertheless remember that there are more correct ways to
% switch languages with the \texttt{babel} commands without changing
% the infix strings.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\italiano{\selectlanguage{italian}}%
\def\english{\selectlanguage{english}}%
\let\inglese\english
%    \end{macrocode}
% At the beginning of the document the following commands are executed;
% the general macro |\italiano| sets the summary and the acknowledgements
% names in Italian, as the main language; and the |\@chapapp| macro is
% redefined so as to agree with the default language. If a different
% default language is desired, we recall it again, it is necessary to do
% the following:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item specify |\english| \emph{after} the |\begin{document}| statement,
%     if English is supposed to be the main language, or
% \item specify the language name, other than Italian or English, among
%     the class options; use the |\ExtendCaptions| macro for extending the
%     list of sectioning commands infix strings as explained above;
%     specify with |\selectlanguage| the new language as the default one
%    \emph{after} the |\begin{document}| statement;
% \item if XeLaTeX is being used for typesetting it suffices to specify
%    in the preamble the name of the other language to be used, by means
%    of the |setotherlanguage| command, and to define the summary and
%    acknowledgments names in the same way as with pdf\/\LaTeX; the same
%    must be done at the beginning of the document to declare the new
%    language a the default one.
% \end{enumerate}
%    \begin{macrocode}
\AtBeginDocument{%
    \italiano
    \renewcommand\@chapapp{\chaptername}%
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% At last the subsidiary and independent packages \texttt{topcoman} and
% \texttt{topfront} are requested for input; the former is loaded only when
% the  |documentclass| option |noTOPfront| has NOT been declared.
% For using XeLaTeX as the typesetting engine it's necessary to load such
% packages at the ``begin document'' step, so that all the other settings,
% especially fonts, are already established. Even if the past experience
% has shown that loading these packages does not need to be deferred al the
% ``begin document'' level with pdf\/\LaTeX, it does not hurt to delay their
% loading operation with both engines. This delayed loading implies that the
% commands defined in |topfront| and in |topcomand| cannot be used in the
% preamble.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\AtBeginDocument{%
	\unless\ifT@Pfrontespizio
       \RequirePackage{topfront}
    \fi
	\RequirePackage{topcoman}%
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% Last but not least, here come the specifications for the PDF/A-1b format.
% First of all the patches to the macros |\not| and |\mapstochar| that produce
% problems with the format, because they have a declared width of 0\,pt; this
% is no problem for \texttt{latex} or \texttt{pdflatex}, but it is a problem
% for the PDF/A format.
% Therefore these commands must be replaced by equivalent ones that do not use
% zero-width glyphs. For |\not|, another slash can be used, but in order to
% have it the right size in all math typesetting modes it is necessary to have
% a different command for every mode; this is achieved with the |\mathchoice|
% primitive as such:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\ifPDFTeX
\renewcommand*\not{\mathrel{\mathchoice%
	{\rlap{$\displaystyle\mkern2.5mu\mathnormal{/}$}}%
	{\rlap{$\textstyle\mkern2.5mu\mathnormal{/}$}}%
	{\rlap{$\scriptstyle\mkern2.5mu\mathnormal{/}$}}%
	{\rlap{$\scriptscriptstyle\mkern2.5mu\mathnormal{/}$}}%
}}
%    \end{macrocode}
% Actually the zero-width property of the slash must be simulated with a
% zero-width box but within this box it is necessary to specify the typesetting
% style of the math mode material.
%
% A similar trick is used to patch the |\mapstochar| command but no other glyph
% was found suitable for substituting the original one; therefore we had to make
% it up with the |picture| environment:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\renewcommand\mapstochar{\mathrel{\mathchoice
{\displaystyle\unitlength=0.0555\fontdimen6\font
   \picture(0,0)\put(1,1.5){\linethickness{0.72\unitlength}%
   \line(0,1){6}}\endpicture}
{\textstyle\unitlength=0.0555\fontdimen6\font
   \picture(0,0)\put(1,1.5){\linethickness{0.72\unitlength}%
   \line(0,1){6}}\endpicture}
{\scriptstyle\unitlength=0.0555\fontdimen6\font
   \picture(0,0)\put(1,0.55){\linethickness{0.61\unitlength}%
   \line(0,1){5}}\endpicture}
{\scriptscriptstyle\unitlength=0.0555\fontdimen6\font
   \picture(0,0)\put(1,0.2){\linethickness{0.56\unitlength}%
   \line(0,1){4}}\endpicture}
}}\fi
%    \end{macrocode}
% The above patches are introduced irrespective of using \texttt{pdflatex} for
% producing a PDF/A compliant file; one might need to produce a traditional PDF
% file, or even a DVI file, to be converted to the PS format, in order to
% possibly further transform it to PDF/A by means of \texttt{ghostscript} (see
% the details in the \texttt{ps2pdf.html} file belonging to the
% \texttt{ghostscript} documentationx).
% The patches are avoided if XeLaTeX is being used with the UNICODE math
% definitions.
%
% \subsection{The \texttt{classica} option}
% As mentioned above, the \texttt{classica} option was devised in order to cope with
% theses in humanities and the specifications came from Paolo Ciacchi, a student of
% the University of Trieste, who was preparing a master thesis in classical Greek
% philology. The necessity of the large normal size derived from the necessity of
% having clear mark-up signs among the myriad signs philologists use, that sometimes
% I believe that the philological mark-up requires typesetting environments
% similar to the mathematical ones: in facts the material to be typeset does not form
% linear sequences, as in plain text, but bi-dimensional structures as in mathematics.
%
% The other requirements involve the title page and I agreed to implement them, since
% they are likely to be useful for other universities as well; the effort for
% localising this bundle makes this point less stringent compared to the previous
% versions, but there are other layout fine points that cannot be solved with a simple
% substitution of infix strings.
%
% The singular and plural masculine and feminine strings for ``candidate'' are redefined.
% For other languages the configuration file comes in handy.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\ifTOPfront
\ifclassica
\def\Candidato{Laureando}
\def\Candidata{Laureanda}
\def\Candidati{Laureandi}
\def\Candidate{Laureande}
\fi\fi
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% Since theses in humanities may end up to occupy several volumes (classically
% ``tomo'' in Italian means ``volume'', although the latter word is valid
% also in Italian with  the same meaning but appears to be  neglected by the
% humanists; in English ``tome'' indicates a ``large book''; in Italian the
% meaning nuance of ``tomo'' is a little different because it is used to
% indicate the volumes into which a large printed work is divided; the
% humanists, as usual, know well their words and use them properly!) a
% mechanism is set up to create a different title page for each volume;
% we need a volume counter and a command to start each volume.
% The localisation allows to change the infix string that is going to be
% printed in the title page. But when several tomes are involved, instead
% of using the |\frontespizio| macro or |frontespizio| environment, use
% the |\tomo| macro, that provides to stepping up the volume counter before
% actually printing the new tome title page.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newcounter{tomo}
\newcommand*{\tomo}{\clearpage\stepcounter{tomo}\boolfalse{topTPTlogos}%
   \fr@ntespizio}
%    \end{macrocode}
% Folios as well are to be redefined and also the page styles require a
% redefinition so as to being able to use old style numbers. The macro
% |\lapagina| (it's not a case the this macro name is the direct translation
% of ``the page'') contains the folio number; if it is in roman numerals
% nothing happens, but if the old style numbers are required the folio is
% surrounded by the proper macros so as to expand the folio macro before
% typesetting it in old style. The page style does not need an actual
% redefinition, because the original definition in file \texttt{toptesi.sty}
% already uses |\lapagina| as the typeset folio
% indicator.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\renewcommand*{\lapagina}{%
    \ifnumeriromani
        \thepage
    \else
        \if@ldstyle
            \expandafter\oldstylenums\expandafter{\thepage}%
        \else
            \thepage
        \fi
    \fi
}
%    \end{macrocode}
% But we actually have to redefine the page style for the new headings because
% the  \texttt{classica} option changes completely the left and the right headers
% depending on the option \texttt{autoretitolo}; in this case the left header
% contains the candidate's name and a short version of the thesis title, while
% the right heading contains the chapter (short) title; if this option is not
% in force, headings appear as usual. The redefinition of the \texttt{headings}
% page style is made only if this option is in force. In case of two side printing
% where the left head and the right head are different, the left heading contains
% the author name and the short title name; if there are other authors the first
% author name is printed followed by ``et al.''; if the over all header string
% exceeds the text width, a message is printed so as to induce the user to 
% use the optional |\titolo| argument, the one that is supposed to contain the
% short title. In the right heading there is the chapter title; again if the
% header turns out to bee too wide, a message is issued to the user.
%
% More complicated things are done when typesetting on one side; in facts the
% author name (possibly followed by ``et al.'') and the short thesis title are
% typeset on the left of the only header while the chapter title is typeset
% on the right; in the unlikely situation where these two elements separated
% by at least 2em of white space do not exceed the text width, they are printed,
% but if they do, as it is likely to happen, then my suggestion would be not
% to use the \texttt{autoretitolo} option; but if the user absolutely wants
% this layout, then the author's name, possibly followed by ``et al.'', and
% the short thesis title are set in a vertical box; the same happens for the
% chapter title in another box; these texts are set with ragged margins, and
% eventually these boxes are set one next to the other with an intermediate
% glob of infinitely stretchable glue, and finally set in the header box with
% a rule underneath the two of them. The result might be barely acceptable if
% both vertical boxes do not exceed two lines and no words have to be hyphenated,
% but in general I believe it is an ugly layout; the user is warned!

% The humanists asked me to create some other simple macros: one for skipping

% The first request has a trivial solution, but at least |\paginavuota| is
% much shorter to type in that its expansion.
%
% The environments \texttt{dedica} for the dedication, and \texttt{citazioni}
% for the witty sentences are almost identical; both typeset their content
% with a reduced text width, half of the normal one; this column is typeset
% on the right of the page. The \texttt{dedica} environment is supposed to
% be used in the front matter, while the witty sentence environment may be
% used anywhere. The dedication is typeset in |\Large| font size and in italics;
% if the author wants a different size and/or a different shape s/he must
% specify it at the beginning of the dedication. The \texttt{citazioni}
% environment typesets its material with the default font shape series and
% size, so the author has to specify any change s/he desires. These three
% commands, though, are available irrespective of the \texttt{classica} option,
% so that they can be used also for theses outside the humanities fields.

% This file may input by \texttt{toptesi}, version 5.x provided that the
% |noTOPfront| is not specified among the |\documentclass| options, but
% it can be used as an independent extension module with (hopefully) any
% document class.
%
% It contains all the definition for the composition of just the title page
% along the style requirements of \texttt{toptesi}, version 5.x.
% It makes use of an optional configuration file where the user can define
% a lot of default information and all the infix language dependent strings
% that are peculiar to this title page. Among other things it can typeset
% also the copyright page on the verso of the title page if the
% |\retrofrontespizio| macro argument is not empty.
%
% This file specifies that it requires the \LaTeXe\ format and identifies
% itself. Since this module package might be used to extend the performances
% of other classes, this package does not specify any input encoding,
% on the assumptions that the calling class already provided this information.
% \iffalse
%<*topfrn>
% \fi
%
% In oder to use |topfront| as a stand-alone extension package with other
% classes it is necessary to verify if the |classica| option  corresponds
% to a valid setting of |\ifclassica|; since this test is defined in the
% |toptesi| class, here we need to verify its existence and, in case, to
% set its value to |false|. This implies two points: we need a powerful
% macro package to test a ``switch'', and when this |topfront| module is
% used as a stand-alone one, the settings of the |classica| options are
% not available.

% For the title page we need a special style, in order to put some information

% The headers, due to a specific request of Politecnico di Torino, is to have
% the university logo(s) in the header; other universities maintain their
% logo(s) in the lower part of the page as it was done all the time in the
% past. We need some device to switch positions to the logos, without
% actually changing the page layout. Since the logo(s) are sort of large,
% the header must smash the header contents, so as to avoid any modification
% of the position and size of the other parts of the page. The |TPT@logobox|
% box is being defined later on and the |\logosede| command takes care of
% filling it up. Besides these devices, the |\frontepsizio| command and the
% |frontespizio| environments (with or without asterisk) produce either

% The title page information depends on the type of ``thesis'' that is being
% typeset. The following commands specify the kind of information that is
% going to be typeset. Some boolean variables are automatically set by the
% commands in order to change some formatting depending on the kind of thesis.
% For languages that distinguish feminine from masculine adjectives or
% qualifications some automatic machinery is set up in order to format some
% infix strings in a way that copes with the singular or plural forms; in
% particular when there is a multitude of authors (maximum three) of different
% gender the adjectives or qualifications are set masculine plurals, while
% when there is just one author or the authors are of the same gender the
% adjectives or qualifications are set according to number and gender.
% All this is done by setting or resetting the truth value associated to 
% the boolean variable \texttt{femminile}. The boolean variable
% \texttt{dottorato} controls the PhD thesis format, while the other
% variable \texttt{laureatriennale} controls the formatting of the
% bachelor's degree report. All other theses are treated as master theses,
% and in all cases the appropriate infix string is typeset in the title page:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newif\iffemminile
\newif\ifdottorato \dottoratofalse
\newif\iflaureatriennale \laureatriennalefalse
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%
% The thesis title is specified by means of the following commands; |\monografia|,
% the name of the bachelors degree final report, sets also the corresponding
% boolean variables and redefines the command |\titolo| so as to avoid
% duplications and inconsistencies; of course something might still be inconsistent
% if the commands are given in the wrong order.
%
% |\titolo| accepts an optional argument, the ``short title'', more or less
% as the standard sectioning commands; this is due to the fact that with the
% class option \texttt{autoretitolo} the thesis title is written together
% with the author's name in the even page headings; if the thesis full title
% is too long it produces overfull headlines with ugly results; a short title
% may solve the inconvenience. The |\sottotitolo| command is another way
% to maintain a short title; all the supplementary title information may be
% typeset in  the subtitle.

% \titolo{The tetratricotomy of blond hair}
% \sottotitolo{Accurate measurements of the four fourths

% Things get more complicated for doctoral theses; in general there is no supervisor;
% at most if a professor is assigned to supervise or control the PhD student's work
% this may be called in whatever mode but here we assume his name is input
% with the command |\tutore| even if ``tutor'' does not appear as the best choice;
% in any case in Italian ``tutore'' does not have the same meaning as the English
% ``tutor''.
% Most Doctoral Schools require to name the School's director or
% coordinator instead of the tutor. This is why this person's name can be introduced with
% |\direttore| or |\coordinatore|; the actual label printed over this person
% name is ``Direttore'' or ``Coordinatore''  but it can be changed with
% |\QualificaDirettore|.

% For ``normal'' theses we may have from one to three supervisors and from
% one to three authors; not all universities accept a multitude of supervisors
% and/or authors of the same thesis, but some do; this is why this bundle
% accepts up to three names for each category.
% The |\second...| commands set the plural forms of the labels printed above
% the name lists. For the candidates there are different commands to input
% ladies or gentlemen names; according to the masculine (ending in `o') or feminine
% (ending in `a') commands, the appropriate truth values are assigned to the
% boolean variable \texttt{femminile} and the labels are set accordingly.
%
% Notice that in the case of bachelor degree final report no supervisor name is printed
% even if one or more supervisor names are specified. This must be kept in mind in order
% to avoid surprises in finding missing information in the title page. Further on, there
% are suggestions for circumventing this fact.

%
% The next set of macros is used to typeset the ``date'' of the thesis
% defence or presentation or whatever is done for the final exam. The
% macro is sort of complicated because the input format for this ``date''
% may vary from a single year, to a year range, to a month and year
% specification so that different actions must be taken; if the option
% \texttt{classica} is in force then the formatting of the ``date'' may
% be still different. This command is aliased with |\esamendidottorato|
% which literally means ``defence of the doctoral dissertation'';
% nevertheless both commands refer to a simple date in one of those formats.
%
% |\getseduta| splits the date into its two components, month and year;
% if the argument is a single string without intervening spaces, the first
% one is the string itself and the second is empty; this emptiness may be
% tested and in case the date formatting is modified accordingly. In
% particular if the string is a single spaceless one, this string is
% assigned to |\@submitdate|; otherwise a different treatment is made
% according to the fact that \texttt{classica} is in force; if 
% \texttt{classica} is not in force the total string, including spaces,
% is assigned to |\@submitade|. If \texttt{classica} is in force,
% |\s@dutaclassica| is called with the whole string. On turn% |\s@dutaclassica|
% verifies if the date should be typeset with old style numbers or in the
% usual way; in the latter case the whole string is assigned to |\@submitdate|;
% in the former one the year part may be either a single year or a year range;
% this separation is tested by splitting the year part across one dash;
% if the dash is present the extremes of the year range are assigned to
% |\1| and |\2|, otherwise the year part is a single year. If a single year
% is given this is simply typeset with old style numbers and the appropriate
% commands are assigned to the |\@submitdate| control sequence. If a year
% range is given, this year range is also typeset with old style numbers,
% and the dash is executed with a regular en-dash surrounded with white space.

%    \end{macrocode}
%
% The next macros are used to assign strings to some literal information
% to be typeset in the title page. |\ciclodidottorato| requires an uppercase
% roman numeral (in Italy), but it can accept anything that can precede the
% infix word ``cycle''.
% Macros |\corsodilaurea| and |\corsodidottorato| specify the degree course
% qualification; You would specify just ``Elettronica'', for example, and the
% module will write in the title page ``Corso di Laurea in Elettronica''.
% The infix part may be changed depending on the default language and the
% configuration file.
%
% |\scuoladidottorato| gets the name of the PhD School; |\ateneo| gets the
% generic name of the university; |\nomeateneo| gets the proper name of the
% university. In Italy Universities are generally named after the city they
% are in; in large cities where there are several universities, each one of
% them has a proper name. For example the generic
% name might be ``Universit\`a di Roma'' and the proper name might be ``La
% Sapienza''.
% |\facolta| may receive an optional argument that is the uppercase roman
% numeral specific of the faculty and a compulsory argument that corresponds
% to the type of faculty; for
% example, with |\facolta[II]{Ingegneria}| the package typesets in the title
% page ``II Facolt\`a di Ingengeria''; if the optional argument is not
% specified, no roman numeral is typeset; the infix string \verb*+Facolt\`a di +
% may be changed with the configuration file depending on the default language.
% It might be necessary to define another name
% in place of ``Facolt\`a di\textvisiblespace'', since with recent bills,
% the administrative structure of all Italian universities has been changed
% and the activities formally assigned to the Faculties may be now the
% responsibility of other structures that may have different names in different
% universities. If the internal command defined by |\FacoltaDi| is empty, no
% name is printed at all and the title page will not have any indication of a
% particular faculty or other educational structure. Therefore the Degree Course
% name, specified with |\corsodilaurea| should be always specified. The alias
% commands |\StrutturaDidattica| and |\struttura| are defined as equivalent
% commands to |\FacoltaDi| and |\facolta| respectively.
%
% Finally |\logosede| gets the name of the graphic file that contains the
% information relative to the university logo; it may receive also a comma
% separated list of logo file names, as it might be necessary when a thesis
% is developed in a multiple university environment. If such logo file is not
% available, the user should not specify this command; if the thesis is
% typeset on smaller paper size than A4 or letter, it would be much better
% to avoid inserting one or more logos in the title page; this is particularly
% important when using A5 paper size. Nevertheless this decision is left to
% the user and this package neither controls this fact nor outputs any warning.
% If the user uses this command to insert one or more university logo files
% but some file is not available, the usual \texttt{graphicx} package warning
% is issued but compilation may go on without the missing logo.
%
% The treatment of one or more logo files requires some extra commands and
% control sequences suitable to store temporary data or to specify style
% parameters: one is the name of a save box; another is the default spacing
% between the logos in the typeset page; the third is the height of the logos.
% The default spacing may be set with the help of the macro |\setlogodistance|
% -- notice that the default value is |3em|, and if a different distance is
% desired, it should not be much larger or much smaller than the default one;
% the default logo height is specified as an optional command to the |\logosede|
% command, while the default size is given by the |\interno| length. This length
% is specified in the main |toptesi| package in order to compute the typesetting
% grid, so that if the |topfront| module is used by itself with other classes,
% the existence of the |\inteno| control sequence is tested and if it is
% undefined, then and only then it is defined in this module and assigned a
% default value.
% The save box name is just for internal workings and does not require any
% customisation.
% The analysis and processing to the possible list of logo file names is done
% through the usual means of the delimited argument extraction of the single
% names from the list; the ``string'' of logos is then composed in a save box;
% as the list has been completely processed, the box is measured; if its width
% is shorter than the |\textwidth| it is typeset without further processing;
% if it's larger, on the opposite, the box gets scaled down so that its width
% equals the |\textwidth|.
%
% The |\tutoreaziendale| macro is the last title page addition; several
% students, who work on their thesis or final project in a company, want to
% have the company supervisor name printed in the title page; this does not
% preclude expressing the student's deepest thanks in the acknowledgements
% section, but it does not harm to name this person also in the title page.
%
% Eventually the |\retrofrontespizio| command, that by default is empty,
% allows to typeset a copyright page; the argument of this command is in
% total responsibility to the user who must write it in the thesis main
% language; the user can specify from zero to several paragraphs, separated
% by the vertical spaces s/he thinks best; the argument by default is typeset
% at the bottom of the text block of the copyright page. The user can specify
% any pertinent space at the bottom of his/her argument, so as to set the
% text in the position s/he likes best.
% In order to handle the copyright page in the proper way we need to test
% if its definition is empty or blank so we need the powerful advanced macros
% of the package |etoolbox| that has already been loaded by this module or
% by the main |toptesi| one.

% Finally we have the real macro |\frontespizio| and the corresponding environments,

%
% I recommend to use the environments, a new feature of version 5.85. But the legacy
% command |\frontespizio| is still usable.
% The principle on which these environments work is that the |frontespizio|
% environment typesets the title page with logo(s) set in the page header,
% while the |frontspizio*| environment typesets the logos after the information
% on the title, the possible sub title and tome information, that is
% in the lower half of the title page. In order to achieve this result each
% environment sets the boolean variable |topTPTlogos| to either value |true|
% (for header logos) or |false| otherwise. The key of the different typesetting
% style is this boolean-variable state.
%
% Now, since the internal |frontespizio| environment opening command is
% |\frontespizio| how is it possible to distinguish this opening statement
% from the homonymous user command? The solution is a little tricky, but after
% all very simple. the |\begin| command, with which an environment is started,
% before calling the opening statement defines the internal service macro
% |\@currenvir| to contain the environment name; this is used by the
% |\end| statement to control that it is closing the last opened environment.
% If the |\frontespizio| command is directly used, the |\@currenvir| macro
% does not contain the name frontespizio; therefore if in the opening environment
% definition we check the contents of |\@currenvir| against the string
% |frontespizio| we can decide if the user resorted to the legacy command, or
% the environment was correctly opened by means of |\begin|.
% If the user resorted to the legacy command, the service macro |\fr@ontespizio|
% is called that typesets the title page according to the current status of the
% boolean |topTPTlogos|, a boolean that has a default value but the user can set
% at its will. Otherwise the |frontespizio| environment is regularly executed.
% Notice that the service macro |\fr@ntespizio| tests the state of the boolean
% |classica| and accordingly uses a different page style.

% With the new boolean |AteneoInHead| we can mark these situations where the
% university common name goes into header; with the |classica| option the
% title page \emph{must} have this name in the header and if the user forgets
% to specify one, this module fakes it with a clear message that the university
% name has been forgotten, but at the same time this fake message fills up the
% header position. On the other hand, when the |classica| option has not been
% specified, the user can use either an empty university name or a specific
% name. So only when the |\@ateneo| macro remains empty the university name
% in the header remains really blank; this is good when the university name
% is part of the university logo (this is the case for Politecnico di Torino,
% and for many other universities). When no university name is set in the header
% some little attention in formatting the title page is necessary.

% following the command; for this reason we defined the |\TPTmaybestar| that
% absorbs une following token: if the token is an asterisk, we set the appropriate
% settings for the previous behaviour of the isolated command, but if it is
% not an asterisk we must set it back into the list after finishing the execution
% of the |\fr@ntespizio| service macro, whose function is to set the title page
% information at the proper position, but must not contain any spurious material.

% Greek letters in math mode with the glyphs taken from the math italic fonts, not from
% the math roman fonts, as it is by default; some authors prefer to use both symbols
% with different meanings, so this command lets them do so. This may be useful unless

% The next set of definitions are used to list a program file. There are finer
% packages to perform this task in the CTAN archives. This set of macros has the
% advantage that is very short and light on the computer memory; nevertheless it
% performs its duty pretty well. The font face is the typewriter one; the font
% size is chosen so as to allow approximately 80 characters in the text width of
% the thesis. It respects the possible indentation tabs (ASCII code 9) by
% inserting the correct amount of typewriter spaces so as to align every line to
% the correct left margin which is an `integer multiple of 8' spaces. If the program file
% contains some form feed ASCII characters (ASCII code 12), this \TeX\ code
% inserts a new page command. The code may appear strange, and it does because
% it makes heavy use of the dirty tricks of appendix~D of the \TeX\-book.
% For what concerns the macro |\obeyspaces| (already defined in the \LaTeXe\ 
% kernel) we had to change it in order to abolish a conflict with package |ABC|
% used to typeset music. The latter package is about 15 years younger than
% |topcoman|, so it should be this latter package duty to avoid conflicts with
% pre existing packages; on the opposite we accepted the suggestion of Enrico
% Gregorio, the author of |ABC|, whom we thank very much, because his package
% is much more complicated than this one, so that the conflict is avoided
% more easily by correcting |topcoman|.

% Remember that the comma as a decimal separator is required for all languages
% except English. If you use this module outside TOPtesi, but as an extension
% of other classes or modules, it's up to you to define an ``intelligent comma''
% macro or to load either the |icomma.sty| or the |nccomma.sty| modules that
% define such a macro: the |icomma| package defines the comma as a mathematical
% active character that recognises the subsequent token as a space token so as
% to insert a punctuation comma; |nccomma| behaves more or less as the macro
% defined in TOPtesi and recognises if the following token is a digit so as to
% use a decimal comma.
%
% The following commands are used to write the ``lower case'' roman numerals
% with the small-caps font; in order to avoid complications with missing fonts
% or math environments we make sure to typeset these numerals with script size
% capitals; this solution is not probably the best one but it works; it typesets
% these roman numerals with the current font; in TOPtesi roman numerals are used
% only for folios, but in order to comply with the |hyperref| module, I avoided
% using this new macro for folios; in other situations there are no problems
% with the choice of font shapes and series. We need a robust command in order
% to set the script math size
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareRobustCommand*{\simulatedSC}[1]{%

%
% A user, Antonio Mele, suggested and requested the possibility of having
% the figure and table name inserted automatically when the |\ref| command is
% issued. For single citations the solution works fine, but for range
% references it does not work. In Italian the name must be lower case while in
% other languages, specifically in English, the name has a capital initial.
% Since this feature might be handy in certain circumstances and annoying in
% other ones, this feature can be turned on and off at will with the enabling
% and disabling commands. By default the feature is disabled.
