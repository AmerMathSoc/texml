% 
% \subsection{Column-Pages}
% \label{sec:imp-ovv-colpage}
% 
% In our parallel multi-column typesetting, a column may grow independently
% of other columns and may cross its page boundary asynchronously with
% others.  Therefore, we cannot throw away the contents of a column in a
% page, or a {\em\Uidx\colpage} in short, when a page break occurs in the
% column.  Instead, we have to keep \colpage{}s until all columns are
% {\em\Uidx\sync{}ed} implicitly or explicitly.
% 
% An {\em\Uidx\imsync} takes place when all columns in a page see
% page-breaks to let the page is shipped out.  In general, all columns but
% the last one which arrives the page-break have completed \colpage{}s in the
% page in question and some of them may have succeeding \colpage{}s.
% Therefore, we maintain the list of completed \colpage{}s
% $\Uidx\S_c=|\pcol@shipped|{\cdot}c$
% 
% \SpecialArrayMainIndex{c}{\pcol@shipped}
% 
% for each column $c\In0\C$, where $\Uidx\C=\!\pcol@ncol!$ is the number of
% columns given through the argument of \env{paracol} environment, and the
% set of them $\Uidx\SS=\Set{\S_c}{c\In0\C}$.
% 
% Each element $\Uidx\s_c(p)$ of a list $\S_c$ is an \!\insert! whose
% \!\vbox! contains the 
% $p$-th completed \colpage\footnote{
% 
% Other registers such as \cs{count} are not used.},
% 
% where $p=0$ for the first \colpage{} produced in \env{paracol}
% environment or that following a page flushing macro \!\flushpage!,
% \!\clearpage! or \!\cleardoublepage!.  That is, $\S_c$ is defined as
% follows, where $\Uidx\pbase=\!\pcol@basepage!$ is the zero-origin ordinal
% of the {\em\Uidx\bpage} being the oldest page not shipped out yet.
% 
% \begin{eqnarray*}
% \S_c&=&(\s_c(\pbase),\s_c(\pbase{+}1),\ldots,\s_c(\pbase{+}k{-}1))\\
% &=&\!\@elt!\,\s_c(\pbase)\;\!\@elt!\,\s_c(\pbase{+}1)\;\cdots\;
% 	\!\@elt!\,\s_c(\pbase{+}k{-}1)
% \end{eqnarray*}
% 
% Note that a list $\S_c$ can be empty and all members in $\SS$ may be empty.
% 
% The other type of \sync{}ation, {\em\Uidx\exsync}, takes place by
% \!\switchcolumn!|*| or the beginning of starred \csenv{}s, by
% \Endparacol, or by one of page flushing macros \!\flushpage!, 
% \!\clearpage! and \!\cleardoublepage!.  A flushing \exsync{} ships out the
% pages from $\pbase$ to $\Uidx\ptop=\!\pcol@toppage!$ being the ordinal of
% the {\em\Uidx\tpage} to which the most advanced {\em\Uidx\lcolumn} has
% reached.  On the other hand, other non-flushing \exsync{} keeps the page
% $\ptop$ from being shipped out because the \colpage{}s in it or the page
% itself will grow further.

%	{Remove $\mu$ for \cs{@mparbottom} from column-context because it is
%	 now in page context.}
% 
% We also have to maintain another type of \colpage{}s which are currently
% built, or {\em\Uidx\ccolpage{}s} in short, to switch from a column to
% another.  Since each column may have its own {\em context} for the
% typsetting of it, or {\em\Uidx\cctext} in short, it were perfect to save
% the context when we leave from a 
% column and to restore that when we revisit the column if we could.
% However, \TeX{} and \LaTeX{} has a tremendously large number of context
% variables and the number becomes virtualy boundless when we take variables
% defined in various styles and by users themselves into account.
% Therefore, we had to abandon to keep the whole context of the column but
% carefully chose a small subset comprising variables automatically modified
% outside of users' control.  That is, the \cctext{}
% $\Uidx\cc_c=|\pcol@col|{\cdot}c$
% 
% \SpecialArrayMainIndex{c}{\pcol@col}
% 
% of a column $c$ consists of the following elements, each of which named
% $e$ is referred to as $\cc_c(e)$ hereafter.
% 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item $\Uidx\vb$
% represents $\!\insert!{\cdot}\vb$ containing the followings.
% 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
% $\vb^b=\!\box!{\cdot}\vb=\!\@holdpg!$ is the \!\vbox! containing the main
% vertical list which has already contributed to the \ccolpage{}.
% 
% \item
% $\vb^p=\!\count!{\cdot}\vb=\!\pcol@page!$ means the \ccolpage{} belongs to
% the page $\vb^p$.
% 
% \item
% $\vb^r=\!\dimen!{\cdot}\vb=\!\@colroom!$ is the room of the column.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% \item $\Uidx\ft=\Midx{\!\pcol@currfoot!}$
% is the \!\insert! containing the footnotes added in the \ccolpage, if
% \Mcfnote{} typesetting is in effect.  Its constituent \!\box!, \!\count!,
% \!\dimen! and \!\skip! are denoted as $\ft^b$, $\ft^c$, $\ft^d$ and
% $\ft^s$ respectively.  On the other hand, if \Scfnote{} typesetting is in
% effect, $\ft$ is always empty\footnote{
% 
% But the macro \cs{pcol@currfoot} is used to keep \Scfnote{}s temporarily.}.
% 
% \item $\Uidx\pd=\!\pcol@prevdepth!$
% is the depth of the last vertical item in $\vb^b$ obtained by
% \!\prevdepth!.
% 
% \item $\Uidx\tl=\!\@toplist!$
% is the list of top floats inserted in the \ccolpage.
% 
% \item $\Uidx\ml=\!\@midlist!$
% is the list of mid floats inserted in the \ccolpage.
% 
% \item $\Uidx\bl=\!\@botlist!$
% is the list of bottom floats inserted in the \ccolpage.
% 
% \item $\Uidx\dl=\!\@deferlist!$
% is the list of \cwise{} floats deferred to the next \colpage.
% 
% \item $\Uidx\tf=\!\pcol@textfloatsep!$
% is the vertical skip used instead of \!\textfloatsep! for top floats in the
% \ccolpage{} if it has \sync{}ation points, or $\infty$ otherwise.
% 
% \item $\Uidx\fh=\!\@textfloatsheight!$
% is the total height of mid floats and their separators in the \ccolpage.
% 
% \item $\Uidx\tn=\!\@topnum!$
% is the maximum number of top floats which the \ccolpage{} can accommodate
% further.
% 
% \item $\Uidx\tr=\!\@toproom!$
% is the room for top floats in the \ccolpage.
% 
% \item $\Uidx\bn=\!\@botnum!$
% is the maximum number of bottom floats which the \ccolpage{} can accommodate
% further.
% 
% \item $\Uidx\br=\!\@botroom!$
% is the room for bottom floats in the \ccolpage.
%
% \item $\Uidx\cn=\!\@colnum!$
% is the maximum total number of floats which the \ccolpage{} can accommodate
% further.
% 
% \item $\Uidx\sw$
% is the following encoding of \CSIndex{if@nobreak} and
% \CSIndex{if@afterindent} at the time we left from the column $c$.
% $$
% \sw=\cases{0&$\CSIndex{if@nobreak}=\false$\cr

%               \CSIndex{if@afterindent}=\false$}
% $$
% Note that we have only three states because \CSIndex{if@afterindent} is
% meaningful only when $\CSIndex{if@nobreak}=\true$\footnote{
% 
% If only with the standard \LaTeX{} and so far.}.
% 
% \item $\Uidx\ep=\!\everypar!$
% is the tokens stored in \!\everypar! at the time we left from the column
% $c$.

% Therefore, $\pp^m(p)$ is emptied by

% \!\pcol@addmarginpar! when it adds a marginal note through macros
% \!\pcol@getmparbottom! and \!\pcol@setmpbelt!.  Another modifier
% \!\pcol@output@start! initializes one of the element $\mpb_L^{\{l,r\}}$
% with the value representing the last marginal note in \preenv{}, while
% another examiner \!\pcol@output@end! lets the outside \!\@mparbottom! have
% a value based on $b_n$ of one of the element, according to \LaTeX's
% setting of marginal note placement.  The whole elemnt $\pp^m(p)$ is often
% {\em cached} in the macro \Midx{\!\pcol@mparbottom!}.  The usage of this
% element is discussed in \secref{sec:imp-ovv-cswap} a little bit more
% detailedly.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% Note that even in \parapag{}ing and in \npaired{} one in particular,
% a page $p$ consists of all columns $c\In0\C$.  Therefore, the term {\em
% left\slash right \parapag{}e} $p$ always mean the left and right component
% of a \parapag{}e (pair) $p$.
% 
% The reason why we keep track of $\page(p)$ is that page numbering is not
% necessrary to be consecutive.  If such a {\em jump} occurs randomly in any
% columns explicitly updating \counter{page}, it is very tough to give a
% consistent view of the page number of a specific page to all columns.
% Therefore we suppose jumps occur only in the leftmost column 0\footnote{
% 
% But we neither inhibit nor nullify a jump in non-leftmost column and thus
% the update can be seen referring to \texttt{page} counter explicitly.}
% 
% which controls the page numbering, while non-leftmost columns are expected
% to refer the \counter{page} passively.
%
% This page numbering is implemented as follows.  Each time a \colpage{} at
% $p$ of the leftmost column is completed to start a new \colpage{},
% $\page(p)$ is fixed to be the value of \counter{page} and
% $\page(q)=\pp^p(q)$ for all $q\in[p,\ptop]$ are let be $\page(p)+(q-p)$ in
% usual cases but $\page(p)+2(q-p)$ in \npaired{} \parapag{}ing.
% This update also takes place on \cswitch{} from the leftmost \colpage{} at
% $p$ to another column so that a jump happning before the switching is
% notified to other columns.  On the other hand, starting or \cswitch{} to a
% non-leftmost \colpage{} at $p$ lets \counter{page} have $\page(p)$
% referring to $\pp(p)$, unless the column starts the most advanced \tpage.
% In this new \tpage{} case, $\pp(\ptop{+}1)$ is added to $\PP$ with the
% temporary setting $\pp^p(\ptop+1)=\page(\ptop+1)=\page(\ptop)+1$ usually but
% $\pp^p(\ptop+1)=\page(\ptop+1)=\page(\ptop)+2$ in \npaired{}
% \parapag{}ing, and $\ptop$ is incremented.
% 
% Note that this management is imperfect because direct references of
% \counter{page} in non-leftmost columns can give inconsistent results if 
% \counter{page} is modified in a non-leftmost column or the reference occurs
% in a page $p$ after that the leftmost column modifies \counter{page} in a
% page $q$ such that $q\leq p$.  In addition to them, this mechanism in
% \npaired{} \parapag{}ing always gives incorrect page number to the
% columns in a right \parapag{}e because $\pp^p(p)$ always has $\page(p)$
% for the left \parapag{}e.  However, it is expected that the progress of
% the leftmost column usually preceeds other columns to give consistent
% \counter{page} reference even with jumps, unless the reference is made by
% a column in a right \npaired{} \parapag{}e.  More importantly, it is
% assured that indirect refereces through |.aux| records and page numbers
% recorded in |.toc|, |.idx|, and so on are always consistent because of the
% lazy evaluation of $\counter{page}=\page(p)$ at ship-out of an ordinary
% page $p$ or a left \parapag{}e $p$, while the counter is let have
% $\page(p)+1$ when a right \npaired{} \parapag{}e $p$ is shipped out.
% 
% Also note that we also keep $\pp(\ptop)$ in \Midx{\!\pcol@currpage!}
% which is initialized by \!\pcol@output@start! to let $\pp^i(\ptop)$ have
% the \preenv.  Then the macro is redefined to have the value representing
% the new page possibly with $\pp^i(\ptop)$ for \pwise{} floats in
% \!\pcol@startpage! by the macro \!\pcol@defcurrpage!.  Another
% \!\def!inition is done in \!\pcol@output@switch! also with
% \!\pcol@defcurrpage! to let $\pp^f(\ptop)$ have \Scfnote{}s built in
% \!\footins! if \scfnote{} typsetting is in effect and the \cswitch{}
% leaves the column in $\ptop$\footnote{
% 
% The \!\def!inition of \!\pcol@currpage! in \!\pcol@setpnoelt!, and
% emptying it in \!\pcol@output@start! and \!\pcol@freshpage! are for coding
% trick and thus not for giving a really new \!\def!initions.}.
% 
% We denote the concatenation of $\PP$ and $\pp(\ptop)$ as $\Uidx\PPP$ to
% represent all pages {\em on-the-fly}.
% 
% 
% 
% \subsection{Counters}
% \label{sec:imp-ovv-counter}
% 
% Besides the context variables discussed in \secref{sec:imp-ovv-ccol}, we
% need to make counters local to each column except for those declared to be
% global by \!\globalcounter!.  Let $\Uidx\CC$ be the set (list) of all
% counters declared before \beginparacol, i.e., $\CC=\!\cl@@ckpt!$, and
% $$
% \Uidx\CG=\!\pcol@gcounters!=\{\Uidx\cg_1,\ldots\}=\!\@elt!|{|\cg_1|}|\cdots
% $$
% be the set of {\em\Uidx\gcounter{}s} which have declared so by
% \!\globalcounter!|{|$\cg_i$|}|.  Then the set of {\em\Uidx\lcounter{}s}
% $\Uidx\CTL$ is defined as follows.
% 
% \SpecialMainIndex{\pcol@counters}
% $$
% \CTL=\CC-\CG=\!\pcol@counters!=\{\Uidx\cl_1,\ldots\}=\!\@elt!|{|\cl_1|}|\cdots
% $$
% 
% Since each column has its own values in \lcounter{}s, we have to keep the
% set of counter\slash value pairs
% 
% \SpecialArrayMainIndex{c}{\pcol@counters}
% $$
% \Uidx\Cc_c=\!\pcol@counters!{\cdot}c=\{\<\cl_1,\val_c(\cl_1)\>,\ldots\}
% =\!\@elt!|{|\cl_1|}||{|\val_c(\cl_1)|}|\cdots
% $$
% for each column $c$, where $\Uidx\val_c(\cl_i)$ is the value of a counter
% $\cl_i$ local to $c$.  That is, whenever we switch from a column $c$ to
% $d$, we save $\<\cl_i,\val_c(\cl_i)\>$ in $\Cc_c$ and restore $\cl_i$ for
% $d$ by letting it have $\val_d(\cl_i)$ in $\Cc_d$, for all $\cl_i\in\CTL$.
% 
% A \gcounter{} is free from these save\slash restore operations but needs
% another special operation when it is incremented by \!\stepcounter!.  That
% is, the invocation of \!\stepcounter! for a \gcounter{} $\cg_i$ may clear
% \lcounter{}s in its set of descendant counters
% $\Uidx\clist(\cg_i)=|\pcol@cl@|{\cdot}\cg_i$
% 
% \SpecialArrayMainIndex{\theta}{\pcol@cl@}
% 
% and this clearing must be performed on the all instances of
% $\cl_j\in\clist(\cg_i)$ saved in $\Cc_c$ for all $c\In0\C$.  Therefore, on
% the \!\stepcounter!, we do the followings for all $c\In0\C$; temporarily
% restore all $\cl_k\in\CTL$ from $\Cc_c$; clear all $\cl_j\in\clist(\cg_i)$;
% and then save $\<\cl_k,\val_c(\cl_k)\>$ back to $\Cc_c$.
% 
% The other item we maintain for a \lcounter{} $\cl$ is its {\em\Uidx\lrep}
% $\arg{rep}$ in a column $c$ defined by
% $\!\definethecounter!\<\cl\>\<c\>\arg{rep}$.  The \lrep{} $\arg{rep}$ is
% kept in $|\pcol@thectr@|{\cdot}\cl{\cdot}c$ and is made \!\let!-equal to
% $|\the|{\cdot}\cl$ when the column $c$ is visted.

% \Uidx{\Index{page-wise footnote}}{\em Page-wise footnote}
% typesetting is completely different from ordinary {\em\Mcfnote}
% typesetting.
% 
% When a \colpage{} in the \tpage{} is built, \!\footins! keeps all footnotes
% \!\insert!ed by \!\footnote! or \!\footnotetext! in {\em any} columns in
% the page.  Therefore, \!\footnote! and \!\footnotetext! in the \tpage{}
% act as usual to add the footnote to \!\footins!.  Then if a \cswitch{}
% takes place to leave the column, \!\footins! is saved into $\pp^f(\ptop)$
% by \!\pcol@output@switch!, so that $\pp^f(\ptop)$ is \!\insert!ed to
% \!\footins! again by \!\pcol@restartcolumn! when it visits a column in
% $\ptop$, or by \!\pcol@startcolumn! when it finds a column proceeds to
% $\ptop$.
% 
% Then, when a \colpage{} in the \tpage{} completes advancing $\ptop$,
% \!\footins! is kept in $\pp^f(\ptop{-}1)$ by \!\pcol@startpage!, rather
% than being combined with the \colpage{}.  This saving into
% $\pp^f(\ptop{-}1)$ {\em fixes} the footnotes in $\ptop{-}1$ so that
% $\pp^f(\ptop{-}1)$ is combined with other materials in the page by
% \!\pcol@outputelt! or \!\pcol@makeflushedpage! through \!\pcol@putfootins!
% when the page is shipped out.
% 
% Fixing $\pp^f(p)$ for $p<\ptop$ makes it impossible to add footnotes in a
% column in the page $p$ not only to $\pp^f(p)$ but also to \!\footins!
% for the page $p$ becaues we have at least one fixed \colpage{} $\s_c(p)$
% unable to shrink to have such additional footnotes in $p$\footnote{

% hard.}.

% are \!\insert!ed to \!\footins! by \!\pcol@deferredfootins! invoked in
% \!\pcol@restartcolumn! when it visits a column in $\ptop$, or in
% \!\pcol@startcolumn! when it starts a \colpage{} in $\ptop$.  The macro
% \!\pcol@output@end! also do the \!\insert!ion by itself with \Mgfnote{}
% typesetting to let deferred footnotes be a part of \postenv.
% 
% The reference to $\pp^f(p)$ for $p<\ptop$ is also made in
% \!\pcol@restartcolumn! and \!\pcol@flushcolumn!.  The former \!\insert!s
% $\pp^f(p)$ to \!\footins! so that the \colpage{} which the macro restarts
% is built as if it has the footnotes in $\pp^f(p)$ to make the \colpage{}
% broken leaving the space for the footnotes.  However, \!\footins! is never
% grown because it has been fixed and thus additional footnotes will go
% to $\df$ as discussed above.  Then \!\footins! is discarded by
% \!\pcol@makecol! when the \colpage{} completes, or by
% \!\pcol@output@switch! when it leaves the column.
% 
% The reference to $\pp^f(p)$ by the latter macro \!\pcol@flushcolumn! is to
% build the ship-out image of the \colpage{} to be flushed.  When this macro
% and other macros, namely \!\pcol@makecol! and \!\pcol@makeflushedpage!,
% build the ship-out image in a page $p$ having $\pp^f(p)$ using
% \!\@makecol!, we have to be careful of the fact that the \colpage{} has
% been build as if it has footnotes in $\pp^f(p)$ but the footnotes are not
% included in its ship-out image but that of the page.  Therefore,
% \!\@colht! referred in \!\@makecol! should be shrunk by the sum of
% height and depth of $\pp^f(p)$ and $\!\skip!\cdot\pp^f(p)$ by
% \!\pcol@shrinkcolbyfn!.  Other and more subtle adjustment is to add the
% stretch and shrink factors of $\!\skip!\cdot\pp^f(p)$ at the tail of the
% \colpage{} by \!\pcol@unvbox@cclv!.  This is necessary because \TeX{} has
% broken the \colpage{} taking acount the stretch and, more essentially,
% shrink factors, and thus without the factors the main vertical list in the
% \colpage{} could be a little bit taller than \!\@colht! causing overfull.
% 
% The feature gathering footnotes in all columns in a page brings a problem
% to \exsync{}, because a column whose contents fit the \tpage{} at the
% last visit may be too tall on the \sync{}ation because other columns have
% put some footnotes after the last visit.  That is, we cannot simply build
% the \tpage{} combining $\s_c(\ptop)$ for all $c\In0\C$ and $\pp^f(\ptop)$
% because there could be $\s_c(\ptop)$ too tall to reside in $\ptop$ with
% $\pp^f(\ptop)$.
% 
% To solve this problem, we perform the following operations prior to fix
% the contents of $\ptop$ having an \exsync{} point in it.  First one is
% {\em\Uidx\cscan} to visit all columns by \cswitch{} prior to the
% \sync{}ation so that \TeX's page builder has opportunities to break too
% tall \colpage{}s.  Since this scan could merely break footnotes rather
% than the main vertical lists in the \colpage{}s and the broken footnotes
% will be reconnected when the \!\output!-routine is invoked for the
% \sync{}ation, we then examine if all $\s_c(\ptop)$ are accommodated in
% $\ptop$ with $\pp^f(p)$.
% 
% This examination for a \sync{}ation by \!\switchcolumn!|*| or its
% relatives is done as a part of the inherent \sync{}ing procedure to see if
% the combination of the tallest {\em top} items, i.e., top floats and the
% main vertical list, and the tallest {\em bottom} items, i.e., bottom
% floats and \Mcfnote{}s, is too large causing page flushing.  As for page
% flushing and environment closing, this {\em\Uidx\pfcheck} requires a
% special kind of \sync{}ed \cswitch{} by which we flush pages up to
% $\ptop-1$ and examine if there is a too tall column.
% 
% Then if too tall columns are found, in either cases, we move to the {\em
% tallest} column to force a page break in the column so that we have a new
% page with shorter columns and shorter \Scfnote{}s as well.  In the
% \sync{}ation by \!\switchcolumn!|*| or its relatives, this forced page
% break is then applied to all other columns so that new \colpage{}s have
% top floats, if any, below which we should place the \sync{}ation point.
% This examination and forced page break is repeated until we have a page
% without any too tall columns, because a page break may bring deferred
% floats and footnotes which may result in a too tall column.

% \changes{v1.3-5}{2013/09/17}
%	{Change the subsection title from ``Coloring'' to ``Text Coloring''
%	 to distinguish it from background painting clearly.}
% 
% \subsubsection{Fundamental Mechanism}
% \label{sec:imp-ovv-color-fundamental}
% 
% Text coloring done by \textsf{color} package and its relatives using
% \!\special! stands on the fact that the main vertical list is {\em
% printed} in the order of occurrence in the source |.tex|.  That is, a
% command such as \!\color!|{red}| puts
% \!\special!|{color push [1 0 0]}|\footnote{
% 
% If \texttt{.dvi} is processed by \texttt{dvips}, or other
% printer-dependent command corresponding to it.}
% 
% into |.dvi| to make all stuff in the main vertical list colored red until
% other coloring \!\special! inserted by other coloring macro appears in
% |.dvi|.  This simple mechanism works well even when the pair of coloring
% \!\special!s are in different pages and/or columns because, with respect
% to the main vertical list, everything between them in |.tex| is also
% surrounded by the \!\special! pair in |.dvi|.  As for other stuff such as
% header, footer, floats and footnotes, \LaTeX{} surrounds them by
% \!\color@begingroup! and \!\color@endgroup! or other similar constructs so
% that they are colored without interference with the coloring of the main
% vertical list.
% 
% In \env{paracol} environment, however, the orders of the main vertical list
% in |.tex| and |.dvi| are not always same.  When a column encounters a page
% break, in |.dvi| the other column should intervene between the stuff in
% the broken pair of \colpage{}s possibly changing the color of the second
% \colpage.  A \cswitch{} from $c_1$ to $c_2$ also makes the main vertical
% list out-of-order to cause another unexpected coloring because a coloring
% command in $c_2$ will have no effect when $c_1$ is revisited after that
% following its pre-switching stuff in |.dvi| which was put before the
% coloring.  Therefore, we have to make {\em\Uidx\colorctext{}s} in both
% |.tex| and |.dvi| coherent inserting appropriate \!\special!s into |.dvi|
% whenever an out-of-order {\em jump} occurs in |.dvi| by a page break or in
% |.tex| by a \cswitch{}.
%
% The \textsf{color} package and its relatives\footnote{
% 
% And all other coloring mechanism compliant with \LaTeXe{}, hopefully and
% believingly.}
% 
% assume that {\em printers} have a stack for coloring and thus a coloring
% \!\special! pushes the new color into the stack while it is popped by
% another \!\special! which will be inserted by \!\aftergroup!  mechanism
% when a group surrounding the coloring \!\special! is closed.  Therefore we
% have to keep track of the \colorctext{} with {\em\Uidx\colorstack}
% $$
% \Uidx\cst=\Midx{\!\pcol@colorstack!}=(\Uidx\celt_1,\celt_2,\ldots,\celt_n)=
% \!\@elt!|{|\celt_1|}|\;\!\@elt!|{|\celt_2|}|\;\cdots\!\@elt!|{|\celt_n|}|
% $$
% to which we push $\celt=\!\current@color!$ when \!\set@color! is invoked
% and from which we pop it when the corresponding \!\reset@color! appears.
% Then when we encounter an out-of-order jump, at first we rewind the
% \colorstack{} in |.dvi| by putting \!\special!s which \!\reset@color!
% would put, and then reestablish the \colorstack{} by putting \!\special!s
% as if \!\set@color! for $\celt_i$ is invoked for all $\celt_i\in\cst$.
% Therefore from the viewpoint of a {\em printer}, it will see
% stack-rewinding at the end of each \colpage{} and the leaving points of
% \cswitch{}, while the beginning of each \colpage{} and the entry points of
% \cswitch{} should have the sequence of coloring \!\special!s to regain the
% \colorstack{} which the {\em printer} must have at each of the points.
% 
% \SpecialArrayMainIndex{c}{\pcol@columncolor}
% 
% In addition, for each column $c$ we keept
% $\Uidx\Celt^c=|\pcol@columncolor|\cdot c$ as the {\em default} color of
% the column $c$, optionally given by the API macro \!\columncolor!.  If
% given for $c$, it is assumed to be at the bottom of the \colorstack{}
% denoted by $\Uidx\CST^c=(\Celt^c,\celt_1,\ldots,\celt_n)$ which we
% rewind\slash reestablish at each out-of-order jump in the column $c$.

% 
% \subsubsection{Coloring in Horizontal Mode}
% \label{sec:imp-ovv-color-hmode}
% \changes{v1.22}{2013/06/30}
%	{Add the subsection ``Coloring in Horizontal Mode''.}
% 
% We have to pay attention to the fact a coloring command can appear in
% horizontal mode of course, and thus push/pop operations in a \colpage{}
% would be done {\em before} the \colpage{} starts when \!\set@color! or
% \!\reset@color! is in the second half of a page-crossing paragraph and if
% we immediately performed push\slash pop of the \colorstack{} in these
% macros.  In addition, even in vertical mode these macros can appear before
% a page break after which they must be in effect, if they are preceded by a
% vertical item to make a break before it and an inhibiting penalty 10000
% which {\em delays} \TeX{} examining the break and thus invoking \!\output!.
% 
% In order to solve the problem of push/pop timing, we maintain a list
% $\Uidx{\cstb}={}$\!\pcol@colorstack@buf!
% 
% \SpecialMainIndex{\pcol@colorstack@buf}
% 
% of colors to be pushed in $\cst$, and raise a special \!\output!
% request, via \!\vadjust! if in horizontal mode, for \colorstack{}
% manipulation rather than performing it immediately.  That is, at the
% request itself or at the completion of the paragraph having these macros,
% we have a sequence of \!\output! requests for pushes and pops toghether
% with the list $\cstb$ for pushes, and possibly a request for a page break
% in the sequence or at its tail and/or that for \cswitch{} at the tail.
% Since a request for push moves the first element of $\cstb$ to the tail of
% $\cst$ while that for pop simply pops $\cst$, \!\output! for a page
% break or \cswitch{} should see $\cst$ perfectly consistent with coloring
% \!\special!s in the main vertical list given to the \!\output!.
% 
% The mechanism above especially for horizontal mode has subtle issues as
% follows.
% 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
% If \!\set@color! appears in a \!\vbox!, the \!\output! request for pushing
% is not effective but corresponding \!\reset@color! can be outside of the
% \!\vbox! to make pushes and pops unbalanced because \!\aftergroup! for it
% inserts it just after the closing of the \!\vbox! if \!\set@color! is not
% surrounded by an inner group.  Another problem with this ineffective
% \!\output! request is that the {\em protection} by a dummy request of
% $-10004$ and an empty \!\vbox! from the elimination just after a page
% break should causes a trouble by the latter because the empty \!\vbox!
% is added to the \!\vbox! in question.
% 
% \item
% If we are in vertical mode, we can know if we are in a \!\vbox! by
% \CSIndex{ifinner}.  However, in horizontal or math mode, \CSIndex{ifinner}
% cannot help us because it is true iff we are in a \!\hbox! or in an
% in-text math.  In short, \TeX{} does not provide us with any convenient
% means to know if we are in a \!\vbox!.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% To solve the problem above, we introduced a trick with \!\everyvbox! to
% turn a switch $\CSIndex{ifpcol@inner}=\true$ at the beginning of every
% \!\vbox! in a \env{paracol} environment, by which we supress the
% \!\output!  request for \!\set@color! because a \!\vbox! cannot cross a
% page boundary.  As for that of \!\reset@color!, we suppress it by not
% reserving our own macro \!\pcol@reset@color@pop! for the request by
% \!\aftergroup!.  That is, we reserve both \!\reset@color! and
% \!\pcol@reset@color@pop! with \!\aftergroup! if we are outside of any
% \!\vbox!es, while does the former only otherwise.  By the same reason, we
% supress the requests if we are in restricted horizontal mode, i.e., if
% both \CSIndex{ifhmode} and \CSIndex{ifinner} are true.  On the other hand,
% we cannot supress the request when we are in an in-text math because it
% can cross a page boundary\footnote{
% 
% If an in-text math is in a \!\hbox!, making the \!\output! request is not
% necessary because the math cannot cross a page boundary.  Though we can
% detect it by a trick with \!\everyhbox!, we abandon this idea because the
% request is not harmful.  Another and more serious issue of coloring in
% math mode will be discussed shortly.}.
% 
% Note that the detailed implementation shown in \secref{sec:imp-startenv}
% does not interfere the use of \!\everyvbox! inside/outside of
% \env{paracol} environments or is not affected by the use.
% 
% The implemntation of \!\columncolor! and \!\normalcolumncolor! has issues
% similar to above but a little bit more complicated because we need to
% update $\Celt^c$ at the bottom of \colorstack{} if we are in the column
% $c$.  That is, in addition to adding the specified color to the tail of
% $\cstb$ and making a special \!\output! request for update, we need to
% rewind the stack before updating $\Celt^c$ and then reestablish the stack
% with the updated $\Celt^c$.  A complication is in the fact that the
% \colorstack{} $\cst$ may not be up-to-date at the occurrence of the
% commands.  More complicatedly, the existence of $\Celt^c$ itself is not
% up-to-date because we have to update it by the special \!\output! request.
% This problem is solved by having {\em shadows} of $\cst$ and $\Celt^c$,
% namely {$\Uidx{\cstshadow}=\Midx{\!\pcol@colorstack@shadow!}$} and
% $\Uidx{\Celtshadow^c}=|\pcol@columncolor@shadow|{\cdot}c$,
% 
% \SpecialArrayMainIndex{c}{\pcol@columncolor@shadow}
% 
% into which we push or set a color immediately, and referring to them for
% rewinding and reestablishing the up-to-date \colorstack{} in the
% column-color commands.  Note that the shadows are referred to only outside
% \!\output! routine and thus popping is done automatically by doing push
% operations locally.
% 
% Another attention we should pay is that \!\color! will leave \!\aftergroup! 
% tokens of \!\reset@color! and thus they are invoked just after
% \Endparacol.  However, since we have completed all \colpage{}s in the
% \lpage, the \colorstack{} in |.dvi| should be empty.  Therefore to avoid
% stack underflow, we should reestablish $\cst$ (not $\CST^c$) so that
% elements in the stack are popped by \!\reset@color! invoked with the
% \!\aftergroup! mechanism.  We also take care of our own \colorstack{}
% popper \!\pcol@reset@color@pop! which must do nothing, i.e., must not make
% a \!\output! request, after we completed the \lpage, i.e.,
% if \CSIndex{ifpcol@output} is $\false$.

% 
% \subsubsection{Coloring in Math Mode}
% \label{sec:imp-ovv-color-mmode}
% \changes{v1.24}{2013/07/27}
%	{Add the subsection ``Coloring in Math Mode''.}
% 
% Unfortunately the solution above is imperfect because \TeX{} builds an
% implicit \!\hbox! for a |{|\textit{math stuff}|}| construct in math mode
% and the contents of \!\vadjust! in the construct does not contribute to
% the main vertical list at all\footnote{
% 
% The contents is not thrown away but \cs{vadjust} construct itself is added
% to the list rather than the contents taking away the chance of the
% contribution.}.
% 
% Since the implicit \!\hbox! does not care about \!\everyhbox!, we cannot
% use the trick similar to that with \!\everyvbox!.  Another bad news is
% that built-in \cs{if}s for mode checking cannot help us because we always
% have $\CSIndex{ifvmode}=\CSIndex{ifhmode}=\false$ and
% $\CSIndex{ifmmode}=\true$ while $\CSIndex{ifinner}$ is $\true$ or $\false$
% when we are in in-text or displayed math mode respectively.  Therefore, we
% have to take care of the potential loss and unbalance of \!\output!
% requests for push and pop.
% 
% Since \!\output! requests can be lost, we cannot use $\cstb$ to carry
% colors to be pushed to the stack $\cst$.  We also have to remember that,
% in the cases like |${|\!\color!$\Arg{c}\textit{text}$|}$| or
% |$|\!\textcolor!$\Arg{c}\ARg{text}$|$| expanded to the former, the
% \!\output! request for push is lost while its counterpart for pop survives
% making it necessary to check the existance of pushing counterpart for each
% pop\footnote{
% 
% Since a pop is always in a group one level outer from its push
% counterpart, the pop request should be presented if the push does.}.
% 
% Therefore, we have to find a means for an \!\output! request of a push or
% pop to carry the color to be pushed and the identifier to associate the
% push and its counterpart pop.
% 
% Since the only means we have for the communication with \!\output! routine
% is the page break \!\penalty!, we reserve a set of negative penalties
% $\LP\Uidx\mppush{-}\mplimit,\mppush\RB$ for pushes and
% $\LP\Uidx\mppop{-}\mplimit,\mppop\RB$ for pops to give the identifier $i$ to
% a push, where $i\In0\mplimit$, $\mppush=-10100=-\!\pcol@op@mcpush!$,
% $\mppop=-10200=-\!\pcol@op@mcpop!$, and
% $\Uidx{\mplimit}=\!\pcol@mcpushlimit!=100$.  That is, a coloring operation
% in math mode attempts to make an \!\output!  request with
% $\!\penalty!=\mppush-i$ while the \!\penalty! for its counterpart pop is
% $\mppop-i$.  The color $\Uidx\mcelt_i$ and the identifier $i$ is kept in the
% macro $\cs{pcol@reset@color@mpop@}{\cdot}i=
% \!\pcol@reset@color@mpop!\Arg{i}\~\Arg{\mcelt_i}$
% 
% \SpecialArrayMainIndex{i}{\pcol@reset@color@mpop@}
% 
% which is also used as the token given to \!\aftergroup! in the coloring
% operation.  Then the \!\output! routine for $\mppush-i$ appends $i$ to the
% tail of the list
% $\Uidx{\mplist}=\Midx{\!\pcol@colorstack@mpushed!}=(i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_k)$
% of identifiers of pushes which have been done in the last pargraph made
% just before the invocation of the \!\output! routine, and pushes $\mcelt_i$
% to the \colorstack{} $\cst$.  The routine for $\mppop-i$ invoked by the
% macro $\!\pcol@reset@color@mpop!\Arg{i}\Arg{\mcelt_i}$, on the other hand,
% pops $\cst$ if $i$ is found in $\mplist$, i.e., its push counterpart is
% processed by \!\output! routine to ensure the balance of push and pop.
% 
% To give unique identifier to each push in a paragraph, we maintain the
% counter $\!\pcol@mcid!$ which is incremented after (the attempt of)
% \!\output! request of each push.  Then the counter is zero-cleared by
% \!\output! routine in order to keep it less than $L$ unless, roughly
% speaking, a \colpage{} has a unexpectedly large number of math constructs
% having coloring commands in them.  Then at a push for $i=0$, we clear the
% list $\mplist$ because pushes recorded in it should have been processed by
% the last \!\output! routine and/or its predecessors.
% 
% 
% 
% \subsubsection{Emptiness of a Column-Page}
% \label{sec:imp-ovv-color-emptycol}
% 
% The mechanism above works well with respect to coloring, but it has a
% problem that a \colpage{} created by, for example, a forced page break may
% not be perfectly empty but can have some coloring \!\special!s for
% \colorstack{} reestablishing and rewinding.  They are of course invisible
% but affect the examination of \colpage{} emptiness for \exsync.  That is,
% we examine if a \colpage{} does not have anything by a tricky way by
% \!\pcol@ifempty! but the existence of coloring \!\special!s makes the
% examination failed even if no other ordinary stuff such as boxes and skips
% are in the \colpage.
% 
% Therefore we need to put coloring \!\special!s for \colorstack{}
% establishing and rewinding a little bit more carefully to avoid empty
% \colpage{}s just having such \!\special!s as follows.  When we start a new
% \colpage{}, we don't put \!\special!s for establishing immediately but
% save the \colorstack{} $\CST^c$ into
% $\Uidx\csts=\Midx{\!\pcol@colorstack@saved!}$.  Then when we leave the
% \colpage{} by switching or page breaking, we examine the emptiness of the
% \colpage{} and if so we do nothing, while otherwise we put the
% \!\special!s for reestablishing $\csts$ at the top of the \colpage{}, and
% those for rewinding at the bottom.  Similary, when we revisit a \colpage,
% we examine its emptiness and if so we save $\CST^c$ into $\csts$, while
% otherwise we put \!\special!s for reestablishing $\CST^c$ and nullify
% $\csts$ so that nothing will be put at the top of the \colpage{} when we
% leave it.  By these mechanisms, an empty \colpage{} should not have
% coloring \!\special!s, while non-empty ones should have a sequence of
% triples; reestablishing \!\special!s; ordinary main vertical list items
% including coloring \!\special!s inserted by \!\color! etc.; and then
% rewinding \!\special!s.

% \paragraph{\em Parallel-paging}\UsageIndex{parallel-paging}\hskip-.5em
% to extend the concept of parallel-columning in a page to a pair of
% adjacent pages.  A {\em left} \parapag{}e starts from column-0, has
% $\Uidx\CL$ columns where $\CL$ is given by the first optional argument of
% \beginparacol, while a {\em right} \parapag{}e starts from column-$\CL$
% and has $\C-\CL$ columns.  Since we let $\CL=\C$ when \parapag{}ing is not
% in effect, we may ship out columns $c\In0\CL$ always and then, if
% $\CL<\C$, ship out columns $c\In\CL\C$ as a right \parapag{}e.
% 
% The pair of \parapag{}es can be {\em\Uidx\paired} to comprise a virtual
% page $p$ and thus has common page number $\page(p)$, while
% {\em\Uidx\npaired} \parapag{}ing produces two individual pages from a
% internal page $p$ (i.e., set of all columns $\Set{c}{c\In0\C}$) whose
% left and right components have page numbers $\page(p)$ and $\page(p)+1$
% respectively.  Since a page $p$ is internally considered as the set of all
% columns $c\In0\C$ always, regardless of \paired{} or \npaired{}
% \parapag{}ing, the difference between them arises only in two-sided
% ship-out process in which the header, footer and left-margin are common
% for left\slash right \paired{} \parapag{}s while they have to depend on

% to right-to-left.  It is enabled by the specifier `|c|' of
% \!\twosided!\footnote{
% 
% Or the backward compatible macro \!\swapcolumninevenpages!.}.
% 
% Though it is fundamentally simple because we just need to reverse the
% scanning order of columns from left-to-right (i.e., 0 to $\C-1$) to
% right-to-left (i.e., $\C-1$ to 0) in the ship-out process of an even
% numbered page, there are a few complications in the implementation of
% related functionalities.
% 
% First, a \paired{} \parapag{}e should also be swapped so that a
% \emph{physical} left (resp.\ right) \parapag{}e has columns $\C-1$ to
% $\CL$ (resp.\ $\CL-1$ to 0) in this order.  Note that this \parapag{}e
% swapping also swaps the page in which \pwstuff{} are placed.  That is, if
% both \paired{} \parapag{}ing and \cswap{} are in effect, \pwstuff{} are
% placed in the physical right \parapag{}e, or in other words they always
% placed in the page in which column-0 resides.  Note that since \cswap{}
% with \npaired{} \parapag{}ing is meaningless and thus \cswap{} is
% disabled.
% 
% Second, the side margin to which a marginal note goes can be swapped but
% enabling this swap is independent of \cswap{} and done by the specifier
% `|m|' of \!\twosided!, though almost all users will specify both swapping
% consistently.  Since the side margin for a marginal note is decided in
% \!\output! routine by \!\pcol@addmarginpar! being our own version of
% \LaTeX's macro for maginal notes \!\@addmarginpar!, the page in which the
% margial note resides has been fixed.  However, the number of the page and
% thus its parity may not have been fixed yet due to the possible jump in
% column-0 taking place afterward, unlike \cswap{} for which the page number
% has been fixed because it is performed in ship-out process.  Since it is
% too costly to avoid this possibly wrong placement, we have to accept the
% possibility as \LaTeX{} itself does.  Also unlike \cswap, the swapping of
% marginal notes is not disabled in \npaired{} \parapag{}ing because it is
% meaningful.
% 
% Another remark for marginal notes is that two ore more columns may {\em
% share} a margin, inevitably if a (parallel) page has three or more columns
% or intentionally with a setting of \!\marginparthreshold!.  Therefore, the
% context of marginal notes cannot be in \cctext{} but should be in \pctext,
% or cannot simply give the bottom of the last marginal note (i.e., \LaTeX's
% \!\@mparbottom!) but should show all marginal notes in margins in a
% page\footnote{
% 
% Before version 1.3, we have \!\@mparbottom! in \cctext{} because a column
% has its own area for marginal notes, which can be the gap between columns
% rather than a margin of a page.}.
% 
% Therefore, each \pctext{} has all marginal notes in the form of lists of
% their top and bottom positions in all margins as $\pp^m(p)$, so that we
% find a space for a marginal note in a column to add it to not only to the
% bottom but also into a space between two marginal notes having already
% been put by other columns.
% 
% Third and finally, we have to take care the placement of \mctext{}s.  In
% version 1.2 to which \cswap{} is introduced, we let a \mctext{} belong to
% column-$(\C-1)$ instead usual column-0 so that its left edge is aligned to
% the left edge of the leftmost column, i.e., that of the text area.
% However this simple solution has a severe problem that, if a \mctext{} is
% broken into two pages, its second half should be put in the rightmost
% column.  In addition, even when a \mctext{} does not have page break in
% it, such wrong placement may happen if the text is followed by \!\nobreak!
% and thus a page break is made above the text but {\em after} the text is
% processed.
% 
% In version 1.3, this problem is solved by capturing the first half of a
% \mctext{} in \!\output! routine for the page break in the text, and the
% second half or the whole of it in that for \sync{}ed \cswitch{} to close
% the text.  Since an invocation of \!\output! routine means that it has been
% fixed which page the \mctext{} or its part resides in, we can place the
% text much more reliably expecting the parity of the page number has also
% been fixed.  In addition, this decision making in \!\output! routine allows
% (or forces) us to let \mctext{}s always belong to column-0 preserving the
% consistency of, for example, local counter values referred to in them,
% while we need to shift a text to the left edge of the text area if it
% resides in an even numbered page.  Furhtermore, this \mctext{} capturing
% enables to measure the vertical size of the captured text together with the
% vertical position of its top edge to record them in the list $\pp^s(p)$,
% so that we draw \cseprule{}s skipping the text and painting its \bground{}
% with a specific color different from colors of columns and \csepgap{}s, as
% discussed shortly.

% \subsection{Page-wise Float Placement}
% \label{sec:imp-ovv-float}
% \changes{v1.32-3}{2015/10/10}
% 	{Add the section ``Page-wise Float Placement'' to discuss the
%	 page-wise float problem.} 
% 
% In the release on 2015/01/10, \LaTeX{}'s float placement mechanism was
% drastically changed to avoid {\em out-of-order\/} appearance of \pwise{}
% floats as follows.  Since the cause of overtaking of a \pwise{} float by a
% \cwise{} float is that they are in two separated lists \!\@dbldeferlist!
% for the former and \!\@deferlist! for the latter, in the new implemenation
% the two lists are merged to let all floats go to \!\@deferlist!.  To
% distinguish \pwise{} and \cwise{} floats in the list, \!\end@dblfloat!
% lets the \pwise{} float processed by the macro have a special depth of
% |1sp|, while depth of \cwise{} floats are 0 since \!\@endfloatbox! add a
% \!\vskip! of 0 at the end of the box of floats.
% 
% Then all macros invoked in \!\output!-routine examine the depth of floats
% in the list they are working on against a newly introduced macro
% \!\f@depth! by also newly introduced \!\@testwrongwidth!, so that they
% process only floats of a page/column category specified by \!\f@depth!,
% while those not matching to \!\f@depth! are let go to \!\@deferlist! to
% inhibit succeeding floats of the same type to overtake them.  The
% \!\def!inition of \!\f@depth! is done only by modified
% \!\@dblfloatplacement!, always invoked in a group, to let it have |1sp| so
% that float placement macros usually work on \cwise{} ones with the default
% setting of $\!\f@depth!=\!\z@!$ except for special occasions in which the
% placement of \pwise{} floats is tried.
% 
% Though the mechanism should work well with {\em ordinary\/} multi-columned
% documents, it is incompatible with \Paracol{} almost inherently.  That is,
% in the first place we have to separate float-related lists into the sets
% of them corresponding to columns as we do\footnote{
% 
% If counters \counter{figure} and \counter{table} are global and we have to
% avoid inter-column overtaking with respect to, for example, the partial
% ordering rooted by the top-left corner, merging \cwise{} lists together
% with the merge of \cs{@deferlist} and \cs{@dbldeferlist} might be a
% solution to let the depth of a \cwise{} float be $c\,\texttt{sp}$ while
% that of \pwise{} is $\C$\,\texttt{sp}.  However such implementation is not
% only tough but also doubtful to be worthwhile.}.
% 
% Therefore, it is obviously nonsense to merge the list for  \pwise{} floats,
% i.e., \!\@dbldeferlist!, to \!\@deferlist! of a particular column, and
% thus we have to stick with the conventional implementation to process
% \pwise{} and \cwise{} floats separately as follows.
% 
% \begin{enumerate}\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
% \item
% \label{item:ovv-float-end@dblfloat}
% We \!\def!ine our own \!\end@dblfloat! namely \!\pcol@end@dblfloat!
% whose definition is exactly same as the old version of \!\end@dblfloat!,
% and replace the new version with it by \!\let!ting them equivalent in
% \!\pcol@zparacol! by which start \env{paracol} environments.  Therefore,
% \pwise{} floats composed in a \env{paracol} environment is processed in
% the traditional way, i.e., being inclueded in \!\@dbldeferlist! rather than
% \!\@deferlist! and having ordinary depth 0.
% 
% \item
% \label{item:ovv-float-@dblfloatplacement}
% Each invocation of \!\@dblfloatplacement! in our own \!\output!-routine is
% followed by a \!\let! to nullify the setting of $\!\f@depth!=|1sp|$ done
% by \!\@dblfloatplacement! by doing \!\f@depth!=\!\z@!.  By this setting,
% \!\@tryfcolumn! in \!\pcol@startpage!  and \!\@makefcolumn! in
% \!\pcol@output@clear! work on their argument \!\@dbldeferlist! in the way
% exactly same as in 2014 or before.
% 
% \item
% \label{item:ovv-float-@addtodblcol}
% Among \LaTeX's macros in its \!\output!-routine which we use in our own
% one as well, only \!\@addtodblcol! changed its target from
% \!\@dbldeferlist! to \!\@deferlist!.  That is, if the macro fails to put a
% \pwise{} float to the page we just have started by \!\pcol@startpage!,
% the float is added to \!\@deferlist! rather than \!\@dbldeferlist!.
% Therefore, when we apply \!\@sdblcolelt! to the copy of \!\@dbldeferlist!
% to invoke \!\@addtodblcol! for each of its element float, we have to save
% \!\@deferlist! somewhere, to \!\reserved@c! in reality, and clear it prior
% to the application.  Then after all elements are processed, we have to let
% \!\@dbldeferlist! have what \!\@deferlist! have, while \!\@deferlist!
% should regain its origial contents from the saved place.  A subtle issue
% is that we might work with \LaTeX{} of 2014 or older in which the floats
% are returned to \!\@dbldeferlist!.  Therefore to make \Paracol{}
% compatible with both of new and old versions, we have to {\em add}
% \!\@deferlist! to \!\@dbldeferlist! rather than replacing
% \!\@dbldeferlist! with \!\@deferlist!.  This addition should work well,
% because we clear both lists before the application of \!\@sdblcolelt!  and
% then one of them will have the still-deferred floats after the application
% while the other remains empty.
% 
% \item
% \label{item:ovv-float-@output@start}
% We convert \!\@deferlist! to \!\@dbldeferlist! in \!\pcol@output@start! to
% start a \env{paracol} environment, and peforms the reverse operation in
% \!\pcol@output@end! to close the environment.  Though it is very unlikely
% (or maybe impossible) that the \!\@deferlist! {\em imported\/} in the
% former operation has \LaTeX's (i.e., not \Paracol's) double-column floats
% of |1sp| deep, we make such floats old-fashioned making their depth 0 so
% that they can be put in a page built in the \env{paracol} environment.  On
% the other hand, the latter cannot {\em export\/} a list having floats of
% |1sp| deep because they have been produced in the closing \env{paracol}
% environment or have passed our {\em custom\/} \!\pcol@output@start! when
% they were imported\footnote{
% 
% Therefore, if one try to {\em smuggle\/} a double-column float of the new
% scheme into a \env{paracol} and to pass it through the environment to
% another double-column world, the float will become a single-column one.
% Even if such guy really exists and complains abount this transformation,
% however, we have good right to say ``don't do that''.}.
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% Note that the operations (1), (2) and (4) are fully compatible with 2014
% or older version of \LaTeX{}, because with the old version; (1) 
% \!\pcol@end@dblfloat! is equivalent to \!\end@dblfloat!; (2) modification
% of \!\f@depth! cannot be seen because it does not exist;  and (4) we
% virtually do nothing in the importation.  As for (3), we explicitly take
% care of the compatibility as shown above.

% \subsubsection{Integer Registers}
% 
% \begin{description}
% \item[\Uidx{\!\deadcycles!}]
% is \TeX's primitive register to count the number of \!\output! requests
% made between two \!\shipout! operatios.  It is zero-cleared by
% \!\pcol@invokeoutput! because it can have a large number in a
% \env{paracol} environment.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\outputpenalty!}]
% is \TeX's primitive register to have the page-break penalty with which
% \!\output! routine is invoked.  It is referred to by \!\pcol@output! to
% know whether it has special code less than $-10000$, and by
% \!\pcol@specialoutput! in detail for the dispatch according to the code.
% The register is also used for the communication from the latter, which lets
% it be $-10000$ for our own special \!\output! routines, to the former to
% determine \!\vsize! according to if the register has a value greater than
% $-10004$ or not.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\interlinepenalty!}]
% is \TeX's primitive register to have the page-break penalty inserted
% between two lines.  The register is referred to in \!\pcol@output@start!
% to make \Preenv{} \Mgfnote{}s followed by this \!\penalty! on the
% \!\insert!ion, in \!\pcol@restartcolumn! and \!\pcol@return@from@color! to
% insert the \!\penalty! in the register to resume a \colpage{} unless it is
% suspended after a sectioning command, i.e., $\CSIndex{if@nobreak}=\true$,
% in \!\pcol@deferredfootins!  to let the secnod half of split $\df$ have
% this \!\penalty! as the very first element, in
% \!\pcol@fntexttop!\marg{text} to make the footnote $\arg{text}$ followed
% by this \!\penalty! on the \!\insert!ion, in
% \!\pcol@fntextother!\marg{text} to make the footnote $\arg{text}$ preceded
% by this \!\penalty! in $\df$, and in \!\pcol@fntextbody! to let it have
% \!\interfootnotelinepenalty!.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\floatingpenalty!}]
% is \TeX's primitive register to have the page-break penalty added to
% \!\insertpenalties! if an \!\insert! is moved to the page next to the page

% \!\pcol@fntextbody! for footnote typesetting.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\vbadness!}]
% is \TeX's primitive register to have the threshold of the badness of
% \!\vbox! construction with underfull messages.  That is, if the badness
% exceeds the threshold on a \!\vbox! construction, \TeX{} will complain
% showing an underfull message. In \!\pcol@makenormalcol!  and
% \!\pcol@deferredfootins!, the register is temporarily let have 10000 to
% avoid that \!\@makecol! invoked in the former and \!\vsplit! done in the
% latter causes the message with inevitable underfull.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\showboxdepth!}]
% is \TeX's primitive register to determine the maximum depth of box

% \subsubsection{Dimension Registers}
% 
% \begin{description}
% \item[\Uidx{\!\vsize!}]
% is \TeX's primitive register to have the height of a page or a \colpage{}
% being built.  It is let be \!\@colroom! or \!\maxdimen! by
% \!\pcol@output!.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\hsize!}]
% is \TeX's primitive register to have the width of a page or a \colpage{}
% being built.  It is let be $\w_c$ by \!\pcol@invokeoutput! to restart (or
% stay in) the column $c$, be \!\textwidth! by \!\pcol@sptext! for \mctext,
% and be either of \!\textwidth! or $\w_c$ by \!\pcol@fntextbody! according
% to the footnote typesetting being \scfnote{} or \mcfnote{} resepectively.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\maxdepth!}]
% is \TeX's primitive register to have the maximum depth of the page being
% built.  In \LaTeX, it is assumed that its value is fixed at
% \beginenv{document}, in which the value is saved into \!\@maxdepth!, for
% the typesetting throughout the document, unless a bottom float is added to
% a page in which the register is let have 0 until it is shipped out.  This
% temporary setting for a page with bottom floats has some reasonability but
% its implementation for \env{paracol} environments having \cswitch{}
% from/to a \colpage{} with bottom floats to/from another one without
% them\footnote{
% 
% Unless we incorporate \cs{maxdepth} as a member of \cctext, but we don't
% because the idea of temporary setting itself is too vague to pay the
% effort and a precious membership in \cctext.}.
% 
% Therefore, we let the register have \!\@maxdepth! in \!\pcol@output! and
% \!\pcol@combinefloats! to cancel the temporary setting done in
% \!\@addtobot! for the references by \TeX's page builder and \!\@cflt!
% respectively.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\boxmaxdepth!}]
% is \TeX's primitive register to have the maximum depth of \!\vbox!es.
% The macros \!\pcol@cflt!, \!\pcol@opcol!,
% \!\pcol@ioutputelt!, \!\pcol@combine~floats!, \!\pcol@output@flush! and
% \!\pcol@output@clear! let it be \!\@maxdepth! for the boxes having a
% completed \colpage{} or page to cap the depth of the box.  The macro
% $\!\pcol@@makecol!\<d\>$ also do that when $d=\!\@maxdepth!$ but it can be
% $d=0$ when it is invoked to build \lpage{}.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\splitmaxdepth!}]
% is \TeX's primitive register to have the maximum depth of the \!\vbox!
% being the first half of a box being split.  It is used in
% \!\pcol@deferredfootins! to cap the depth of the first half of deferred
% footnotes split from $\df$, and in \!\pcol@fntextbody! to let it have the
% depth of \!\strutbox!.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\prevdepth!}]
% is \TeX's primitive register to have the depth of the box which just has
% been added to a vertical list, or to be given to \TeX's vertical list
% builder for the calculation of the vertical skip inserted below the last
% box.  The macro \!\pcol@invokeoutput! refers to it to save its value in
% \!\pcol@prevdepth! before putting a dummy \!\vbox! and making a \!\output!
% request, and then let it have \!\pcol@prevdepth! which is given by
% \!\output! routine for the column that we resume.  The macro
% \!\pcol@zparacol!  also refers to it to save it in \!\pcol@firstprevdepth!
% for the \preenv.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\maxdimen!}]
% is a \!\dimen! register to have $16383.99999\,|pt|$ being the largest
% legal dimensional value.  The usages of this register are as follows.
% 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
% In \!\pcol@output!, it is set into \!\vsize! when $\!\outputpenalty!=-10004$
% for the dummy \!\output! request so that no page break should occur
% between the dummy and real requests.
% 
% \item
% Our own \!\dimen! register \!\pcol@textfloatsep! has \!\maxdimen! if a
% \colpage{} does not have \sync{}ation points to let top floats are
% inserted in usual way.  Therefore, \!\pcol@floatplacement! and
% \!\pcol@zparacol!  let the register have \!\maxdimen! as the initial
% value.  Then the macros \!\pcol@makecol! and \!\pcol@combinefloats!
% examine if $\!\pcol@textfloatsep!=\!\maxdimen!$ to determine the operation
% type of top float insertion, while \!\pcol@synccolumn! does that to know
% if it is flushing a \colpage{} with a \sync{}ation point or is setting the
% first \sync{}ation point in the \colpage{}.  The macro \!\pcol@addflhd!
% also examines it for the measurement of the combined height of top and
% bottom floats, while \!\pcol@measurecolumn! gives it \!\maxdimen! as its
% third argument for bottom floats.
% 
% \item
% The \pctext{} $\pp^h(p)$ has $-\!\maxdimen!$ if the page is a \fpage{}.
% The macro \!\pcol@startpage! makes that when it creates such a page.
% 
% \item
% Our own \!\pcol@prevdepth! and that saved in $\cc_c(\pd)$ have
% \!\maxdimen! if the main vertical list is empty at a \sync{}ation.  The
% macro \!\pcol@measurecolumn! makes that when it finds an empty list.
% 
% \item
% The \cctext{} $\cc_c(\tr)$ may have \!\maxdimen! if the column $c$ has a
% \fcolumn{} in the \lpage{} of a \env{paracol} environment and the floats in
% it can be put as top floats.  The macro \!\pcol@makefcolumn! makes this
% special assignment, and \!\pcol@flushcolumn! and \!\pcol@imakeflushedpage!
% examine it.
% 
% \item
% The macro \!\pcol@makefcolelt! let the room for floats in a \fpage{} be
% $-\!\maxdimen!$ if it finds no futher floats can be added to the page.
% 
% \item
% At a \sync{}ation, we measure the maximum combined size of top floats and
% the main vertical list $\VT$, that of footnotes and bottom floats $\VB$,
% that of four items $\VP$, and $\VPP$ being $\VP$ or $\VP+\!\textfloatsep!$
% according to the existence of bottom floats.  We also let $\DT$ and $\DP$
% be the minimum depth of the \colpage{}s which gives $\VT$ and $\VPP$
% respectively.  For the measurement, the macro \!\pcol@sync! lets
% $\VT=\VB=\VP=\VPP=-\!\maxdimen!$ and $\DT=\DP=\!\maxdimen!$ as their
% initial values.  Then the macro \!\pcol@synccolumn! examines if
% $\DT=\!\maxdimen!$ to mean the \sync{}ation point is set just below the
% top floats of a column whose main vertical list is empty.  On the other
% hand, \!\pcol@makeflushedpage! and \!\pcol@output@end! examine if
% $\VPP=-\!\maxdimen!$ to mean the last \colpage{}s are empty.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\linewidth!}]
% is a \!\dimen! register for an API parameter of \LaTeX{} to have the width
% of a line possibly shorter than \!\columnwidth! in \env{list}-like
% environments.  It is let have $\w_c-\lrm$ by
% \!\pcol@invokeoutput! for the outermost paragraphs in \env{paracol}
% environment, where $\lrm=\!\pcol@lrmargin!=\!\textwidth!-l$ which
% \!\pcol@zparacol! lets have to represent the left-plus-right margin of the
% \env{list}-like environment, whose \!\linewidth! is $l$, enclosing
% \env{paracol} if any.  The macro \!\pcol@sptext! also sets the register
% temporarily for \mctext{}s but letting it have $\!\textwidth!-\lrm$.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\footnotesep!}]
% is a \!\dimen! register for an API parameter of \LaTeX{} to have the
% vertical space inserted in a footnote when it is split into two or more
% pages.  It is uesed in \!\pcol@fntextbody! to \!\splittopskip! have it,
% and to make the first line of the footnote is at least as tall as the
% amount in the register.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\topmargin!}]
% is a \!\dimen! register for an API parameter of \LaTeX{} to have the width
% (height) of the top margin minus 1\,inch.  The register is used as an
% element of \!\pcol@bg@pagetop! to calculate the distance from the origin
% at the left-top corner of text area to the top edge of a page.  The
% other users are \!\pcol@ioutputelt! and \!\pcol@makeflushedpage!
% temporarily add the height-plus-depth of $\pp^b(p)$ to the register to
% make the calculation biased shifting the origin to the left-top corner of
% column area, i.e., below $\pp^b(p)$.  The macro \!\@outputpage! also
% refers to the register together with \!\headheight! and \!\headsep! to
% calculate the distance from the page top (ingoring 1\,inch shift) to the
% text area top.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\oddsidemargin!}]
% is a \!\dimen! register for an API parameter of \LaTeX{} to have the width

% \!\pcol@output@clear!, let \!\boxmaxdepth! have \!\@maxdepth! so as to
% limit the depth of boxes for a completed \colpage{} or page to the value
% for page typesetting, while \!\pcol@flushcolumn! and
% \!\pcol@imakeflushedpage! do that by \!\pcol@@makecol! giving the register
% to it.  The other usage of the register is to calculate \bgpaint{}
% parameter $\HT$ by \!\pcol@bg@textheight!, and to determine the bottom
% edge of the \bground{}s of columns and \csepgap{}s through the argument of
% \!\pcol@buildcolseprule! given by \!\pcol@ioutputelt!,
% \!\pcol@imakeflushedpage! and \!\pcol@iflushfloats!.  The register is also
% referred to by \!\pcol@unvbox@cclv! to go back the last baseline of the
% main vertical list in \!\box!|255|, and by \!\pcol@deferredfootins! to let
% \!\splitmaxdepth! have its value to cap the depth of the first half of
% footnotes split from $\df$.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@colht!}]
% is a \!\dimen! register to have the height of columns in a page possibly
% shrunk from \!\textheight! by \spanning.  The usages of the register
% are as folllows.
% 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item\begin{Sloppy}{1600}
% In \!\pcol@startpage!, \!\pcol@output@start!, \!\pcol@flushfloats!  and
% \!\pcol@output@end!, it is initialized to \!\textheight!.  In first two,
% the value of the register is reduced to reflect \spanning{} if exists and
% then set into $\pp^h(p)$, while the setting by the third is referred to by
% its callee \!\pcol@iflushfloats!.
% \end{Sloppy}
% 
% \item
% In \!\pcol@getpelt!, \!\pcol@sync!, \!\pcol@flushcolumn!,
% \!\pcol@makeflushedpage! and \!\pcol@imakeflushedpage!, it is let have
% $\pp^h(p)$.  In addition \!\pcol@sync! examines if
% $\!\@colht!<\VT+\VB+v(f)$, and \!\pcol@makefcolumn! uses it to initialize
% the room of a \fcolumn{} as well as the height of $\cc_c(\vb)$ for it.
% 
% \item
% In \!\pcol@opcol!, it is used to add \!\pcol@clearcolorstack! to the
% bottom of $\cc_c(\vb)$ whose height is \!\@colht!.
% 
% \item
% In \!\pcol@startcolumn!(*), \!\pcol@flushcolumn!(*) and
% \!\pcol@freshpage!, it is used to let \!\@colroom! have it.
% 
% \item
% In \!\pcol@restartcolumn!(*), it is saved and restored for the use as the
% height cap of deferred footnote \!\insert!ion in \!\pcol@deferredfootins!
% because it can be shrunk by the non-deferred \Scfnote{}s.
% 
% \item
% In \!\pcol@output@flush! and \!\pcol@output@clear!, it is given to
% \!\pcol@make~flushedpage! as its argument.  The macro
% \!\pcol@makeflushedpage!(*) lets \!\@colht! be the argument if it is less
% than \!\@colht! and thus is given by \!\pcol@output@end!.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% In addition, in the macros with `(*)' above and \!\pcol@makecol!, the
% register is passed to \!\pcol@shrinkcolbyfn! to shrink the height in it
% temporarily to keep the space required to put \Scfnote{}s in the page they
% are working on, for the reference by starred macros themselves or
% \!\@makecol! invoked in \!\pcol@makecol!.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@colroom!}]
% is a \!\dimen! register to have the height of a column possibly shrunk
% from \!\@colht! by top and bottom floats.  The register is initialized to
% have \!\@colht! by \!\pcol@startcolumn!, \!\pcol@output@start!,
% \!\pcol@flushcolumn! and \!\pcol@freshpage!, the last three of which also
% save it into $\cc_c(\vb^r)$.  This save operation is also done by
% \!\pcol@output@switch! while restoring from it done by
% \!\pcol@restartcolumn!, but the latter macro may shrink the amount in its
% callee \!\pcol@putbackmvl! to capture a \mctext{} while the former cancel
% this shrinkage.  The macros \!\pcol@output! and \!\pcol@output@start! also
% refer to this register to let \!\vsize! have it in the former and to
% calculate the room for each \colpage{} in the \spage{} in the latter.  The
% macro \!\pcol@output@end!  lets the register have \!\textheight! for the
% \postenv{} because the \colpage{}s above it simply precedes the stuff in
% the main vertical list.  The other users \!\pcol@makefcolumn! and
% \!\pcol@makefcolelt! use this register to accumulate the total size of
% floats to be put in a \fcolumn{} temporarily.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@pageht!}]
% is a \!\dimen! register to be used in \LaTeX's \!\@specialoutput! to have
% the height of \!\@holdpg!.  It is referred to by \!\pcol@addmarginpar! to
% deteremine the position at which a marginal note is placed.
% We also use it as a scratchpad to have $\VP$ in \!\pcol@sync! and
% \!\pcol@measurecolumn!, and to save $\pp^h(\ptop)$ in \!\pcol@flushcolumn!
% for the reference in itself, and to do so in \!\pcol@makeflushedpage! for
% \!\pcol@imakeflushedpage!.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@pagedp!}]
% is a \!\dimen! register to be used in \LaTeX's \!\@specialoutput! to have
% the depth of \!\@holdpg!.  However, we use it as a scratchpad in
% \!\pcol@sync! and \!\pcol@measurecolumn! to have $\DP$, and in
% \!\pcol@output@end! to have the value to be set in \!\pcol@prevdepth!.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@toproom!}]
% is a \!\dimen! register to have the room for top floats.  The register is
% saved in $\cc_c(\tr)$ by \!\pcol@setcurrcol! and restored from it by
% \!\pcol@iigetcurrcol!.  The macro \!\pcol@makefcolumn! uses this register
% as a flag to indicate that $\cc_c(\tl)$ of the column $c$ having
% $\cc_c(\tr)=\infty$ contains floats to be put in its last \fcolumn{}
% possibly as top floats so that it is examined by \!\pcol@flushcolumn! and
% \!\pcol@imakeflushedpage!, the former of which then lets $\cc_c(\tr)=0$ to
% mean the floats are put in a \fcolumn{} in a non-\lpage{} by the macro.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@botroom!}]
% is a \!\dimen! register to have the room for bottom floats.  The register
% is saved in $\cc_c(\br)$ by \!\pcol@setcurrcol! and restored from it by
% \!\pcol@iigetcurrcol!.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@fpmin!}]
% is a \!\dimen! register to have $\!\floatpagefraction!\times\!\@colht!$
% being the minimum total size of floats for which an ordinary (not flushed)
% \fcolumn{} can be build.  It is referred to by \!\pcol@makefcolumn! as the
% threshhold below which floats in the last \fcolumn{} can be put as top
% floats.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@mparbottom!}]
% is a \!\dimen! register to have the bottom position of the last
% \!\marginpar! stuff.  Its value at \beginparacol{} is referred to by
% \!\pcol@output@start! to let $\mpb_L^l$ or $\mpb_L^r$ of $\pp^m(0)$ has an
% element based on it, while the tail of one of the lists in $\pp^m(\ptop)$
% defines the value at \Endparacol{} which \!\pcol@output@end! lets the
% register have.  The register is also updated by \!\pcol@getmparbottom! and
% \!\pcol@getmpbelt! to let \!\pcol@@addmarginpar! being \LaTeX's original
% \!\@addmarginpar! know the uppermost available position for the marginal
% note to be added.  This update is, however, just for communicatoin betwee
% these macros and thus is ineffective for typesetting posterior to that, as
% well as the update in \!\pcol@@addmarginpar!, because whole information
% for marginal note placement is kept in $\pp^m(p)$ in $\PPP$.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@textfloatsheight!}]
% is a \!\dimen! register to have the combined height of mid floats and
% their separators.  It is initialize to be 0 by \!\pcol@floatplacement!,
% saved in $\cc_c(\fh)$ by \!\pcol@setcurrcol!, and restored from it by
% \!\pcol@iigetcurrcol!.
%

% \subsubsection{Skip Registers}
% 
% \begin{description}
% \item[\Uidx{\!\baselineskip!}]
% is \TeX's primitive register to have the vertical skip to separate
% adjacent baselines.  It is referred to by \!\pcol@output! and
% \!\pcol@output@start! to examine if \!\@colroom! is unexpectedly small,
% and by \!\pcol@switchcol! to give it to \!\ensurevspace! to let
% \!\pcol@ensurevspace! have the default value.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\topskip!}]
% is \TeX's primitive register to have the vertical skip from the top edge
% of a page to the baseline of its first vertical item.  It is let be 0 by
% \!\pcol@output@start! if we have \preenv{} and is saved in $\pp^t(0)$,
% while \!\pcol@startpage! lets it be \!\pcol@topskip!, into which
% \!\pcol@zparacol! saves the value outside \env{paracol} environment,
% saving the value in $\pp^t(p)$.  Then the register is restored from
% $\pp^t(p)$ by \!\pcol@getpelt! and \!\pcol@sync!, while
% \!\pcol@synccolumn! refers to the value restored by the latter to adjust a
% \sync{}ation point.  The macro \!\pcol@putbackmvl! lets the register have
% 0 when it starts a \mctext{} because it originally follows \prespan{} in
% the \colpage{} to be restarted rather than at the page top.  The macro
% \!\pcol@output@end!  temporarily lets the register have 0 if we have
% non-empty columns in the last page, while \!\endparacol! restores it from
% \!\pcol@topskip! for the pages outside \env{paracol} environmnet.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\splittopskip!}]
% is \TeX's primitive register to have the vertical skip inserted at the
% beginning of the second half of the box split by \!\vsplit! or \TeX's
% internal operation for splitting an \!\insert! at a page break.  The
% register is temporarily let have 0 by \!\pcol@deferredfootins! when it
% splits $\df$ so that the second half does not have any skip at the top.
% The register is also let have \!\footnotesep! in \!\pcol@fntextbody! for
% footnote typesetting.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\parskip!}]
% is \TeX's primitive register to have the vertical skip inserted above each
% paragraph.  It is referred to by \!\pcol@zparacol! to nullify the

% stretch\slash shrink factor of \!\skip!\!\footins! at its bottom for a
% \colpage{} in a page having \Scfnote{}s.  The macro \!\pcol@specialoutput!
% examines the register to discard the dummy \!\vbox! inserted in it by

% 
% \item
% \!\pcol@flushfloats! to let $\!\pcol@rightpage!=\bot$ if \parapag{}ing is
% not in effect.

%
% \item
% \!\pcol@com@flushpage! and \!\pcol@com@clearpage! gives the void box to
% \!\pcol@flushclear! as its argument to mean these macros are only aware

% \subsubsection{Token Registers}
% 
% \begin{description}
% \item[\Uidx{\!\output!}]
% is \TeX's primitive to have \!\output! routine.  It is let have
% \!\pcol@output! as its sole token by \!\pcol@zparacol!.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\everypar!}]
% is \TeX's primitive to have tokens inserted at the beginning of each
% paragarph.  In \!\pcol@sptext! and \!\pcol@com@endcolumn!, it is
% \!\global!ized to keep its contents after the end of a group.  In
% \!\pcol@output@switch!, its contents are broadcasted to $\cc_c(\ep)$ for

% or that simply given in a column are saved into $\cc_c(\ep)$ by
% \!\pcol@setcurrcol!, and then restored from it by \!\pcol@iigetcurrcol!.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\everyvbox!}]
% is \TeX's primitive to have tokens inserted at the beginning of each
% \!\vbox!.  In \!\pcol@zparacol!, after tokens in it are saved into
% \!\pcol@everyvbox!, it is let have a \!\the!-reference to

% register is to insert a painted page \bground{} to the \!\vbox! to be
% \!\shipout! by \!\pcol@@outputpage! being \LaTeX's \!\@outputpage!, and is
% used for this purpose by \!\pcol@outputpage@l! and \!\pcol@outputpage@r!,

% 
% \subsubsection{Switches}
% 
% \begin{description}
% \item[\Uidx{\CSIndex{if@twocolumn}}]
% is a switch to be $\true$ iff multi-column pages are being typeset.  It is
% turned $\true$ by \!\pcol@zparacol!, and then turned $\false$ by
% \!\endparacol!.  In addition, it is turned $\false$ when \!\pcol@output!
% finds that the \!\output! request for a page break outside \env{paracol}
% is sneaked into our own \!\output! routine, in order to avoid that
% \LaTeX's original \!\output! routine misunderstands it is working on a
% two-columned document.  The switch is examined by \LaTeX's own macros
% including old \!\end@dblfloat! kept in our own \!\pcol@end@dblfloat!.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\CSIndex{if@firstcolumn}}]
% is a switch to be $\true$ iff the first column is being typeset.  Its
% truth value is determined by \!\pcol@addmarginpar! to tell
% \!\pcol@@addmarginpar!, \!\pcol@getmparbottom@i! and \!\pcol@setmpbelt@i!
% the margin which a marginal note goes to.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\CSIndex{if@twoside}}]
% is a switch to be $\true$ iff two-sided page typesetting is in effect and
% thus even numbered page may have their own left margins, headers and
% footers different from those for odd numbered pages.  Besides the
% initialization by the main class file such as \textsf{article.cls}
% according to the class option |twoside|, the switch is \!\global!ly turned
% $\false$ by \!\pcol@twosided! for the case in which API macro \!\twosided!
% does not have `|p|' in its optional argument, and then \!\global!ly turned
% $\true$ by \!\pcol@twosided@p! which is invoked when the argument contains
% `|p|', or the API macro does not have the argument at all.  Then the
% switch is referred to by \!\pcol@outputpage@l!, \!\pcol@outputpage@r! and
% \!\pcol@bg@swappage! to decide the left margin of even numbered pages,
% i.e., \!\evensidemargin! if the switch is $\true$ or \!\oddsidemargin!
% otherwise.  The switch is also referred to by \!\pcol@com@cleardoublepage!
% to have a blank page if the switch is $\true$ and the command
% \!\cleardoublepage! is used in an odd-numbered page.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\CSIndex{if@reversemargin}}]
% is a switch to be $\true$ iff \!\reversemarginpar! is specified to reverse
% the side which marginal notes go to.  It is examined by
% \!\pcol@addmarginpar! as a factor to decide the margin which a marginal
% note goes to, and by \!\pcol@do@mpbout@i! for the same purpose but for
% marginal notes in pre-environment or \postenv.
% 
% \Index{pre-environment stuff}
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\CSIndex{if@mparswitch}}]
% is a switch to be $\true$ iff it is specified by, for example,
% \texttt{twoside} option of a class such as \textsf{article}, that marginal
% notes in even numbered pages go to thier left margin.  It is examined by
% \!\pcol@do@mpbout@i! as a factor to decide the margin which a maginal note
% goes to in pre-environment or \postenv{}.
% 
% \Index{pre-environment stuff}
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\CSIndex{if@nobreak}}]
% is a switch to be $\true$ iff the last paragraph is for a sectioning
% command.  The switch is saved into $\cc_c(\sw)$ together with
% \CSIndex{if@afterindent} by \!\pcol@setcurrcol!, and then restored from
% it by \!\pcol@iigetcurrcol!.  The macro \!\pcol@output@switch! refers to
% it to broadcast its value set by a \mctext{} to $\cc_c(\sw)$ for all
% $c\In0\C$, while \!\pcol@restartcolumn! and \!\pcol@return@from@color!
% insert $\!\penalty!=10000$ by \!\nobreak! if the switch is $\true$.  The
% macro \!\pcol@zparacol! also exmaines the switch, but with the truth value
% in it given outside \env{paracol} environment, to invoke \!\@nbitem! if
% $\true$ when the macro finds the \env{paracol} environment to start is at
% the very beginning of a \env{list}-like environment.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\CSIndex{if@newlist}}]
% is a switch to be $\true$ in the duration after a \env{list}-like
% environment starts and until its first \!\item! appears.  The switch is
% examined by \!\pcol@zparacol! to know if the \env{paracol} environment to
% start is at the very beginning of a \env{list}-like environment and, if
% so, is turned $\false$ by the macro after it inserts vertical skips
% pretending the first \!\item! is given.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\CSIndex{if@afterindent}}]
% is a switch to be $\true$ iff a sectioning commmand tells that the fisrt
% paragraph following it is to be indented.  The switch is saved into
% $\cc_c(\sw)$ together with \CSIndex{if@nobreak} by \!\pcol@setcurrcol!,
% and then restored from it by \!\pcol@iigetcurrcol!.  The macro
% \!\pcol@output@switch! refers to it to broadcast its value set by a
% \mctext{} to $\cc_c(\sw)$ for all $c\In0\C$.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\CSIndex{if@fcolmade}}]
% is a switch to be $\true$ iff a \fcolumn{} or \fpage{} is built by
% \!\@tryfcolumn! or \!\@makefcolumn!.  The value is set by \!\@tryfcolumn!
% for $\cc_c(\dl)$ is referred to by \!\pcol@output!, \!\pcol@startcolumn!
% and \!\pcol@freshpage!, while that for \!\@dbldeferlist! is referred to by
% \!\pcol@startpage!.  The value set by \!\@makefcolumn! for $\cc_c(\dl)$ is
% referred to by \!\pcol@flushcolumn!, while that for \!\@dbldeferlist! is
% referred to by \!\pcol@output@clear!.  The macros \!\pcol@flushfloats! and
% \!\pcol@iflushfloats! also refer to the switch to build pages having only
% \fcolumn{}s and turn the switch $\true$ or $\false$ by themselves to know
% such paegs are still to be built or not.  The macro \!\pcol@output@end!
% also turns the switch $\true$ if a \lpage{} will be followed by page(s)
% having \fcolumn{}s to tell that to \!\pcol@flushfloats!.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\CSIndex{if@tempswa}}]

% \!\definethecounter!.  The macro \!\pcol@setctrelt! also makes this
% overriding for the column $c$ to which the macro belongs if
% $|\pcol@thectr@|{\cdot}\theta{\cdot}c$
% 
% \SpecialArrayIndex{\theta{\cdot}c}{\pcol@thectr@}
% 
% being the \lrep{} for $c$ is defined, while it makes $|\the|{\cdot}\theta$
% 
% \SpecialArrayIndex{\theta}{\the}
% 
% \!\let!-equal to $|\pcol@thectr@|{\cdot}\theta$

% is an API macro to put \!\addtocontents! for the arguments to |.aux| file.
% The orignial definition of the macro is kept in
% \!\pcol@addcontentsline! so that \!\pcol@ac@disable@toc! and

% temporarily disabling its function by making it \!\let!-equal to
% \!\pcol@gobblethree!.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\footnote!}\oarg{num}\marg{text}]
% is an API macro to give a footnote $\arg{text}$ optionally with its number
% $\arg{num}$.  In \!\pcol@zparacol! it is made \!\let!-equal to

% is an API macro to draw a horizontal line above footnotes, or to insert
% whatever it has above them.  With \Scfnote{} typesetting, it is redefined
% in \!\pcol@zparacol! so that it refers to \!\textwidth! instead of
% \!\columnwidth! for drawing the horizontal line or whatever defined, while
% the original version is kept in \!\pcol@footnoterule!.  Then it is used in
% \!\pcol@putfootins! to separate footnotes from the stuff above them, with
% the original or modified definition.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\newpage!}]
% is an API macro to break a page.  It is used in \!\pcol@switchcol! as the

% to \!\relax! temporarily by \!\pcol@imakeflushedpage! when it put floats in
% a \fcolumn{} as top floats.  Note that the macro and its bottom
% counterpart \!\botfigrule! should produce a vertical list whose total
% height and depth is 0, because \LaTeX's float mechanism and thus our
% macros believe so.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\normalcolor!}]
% is an API macro to have color specification stuff for normal coloring.
% The macro is used in \!\pcol@putfootins! to specify the color of footnotes
% to be put in \!\@outputbox!, in \!\normalcolumncolor!\oarg{c} to

% is a developer's API macro to stop the exectution showing the error
% message $\arg{msg}$ with the package identification $\arg{pkg}$ and the
% help mssage $\arg{hlp}$.  The macro is used in the following macros;
% \!\pcol@ovf! on \!\@freelist! shortage; \!\pcol@set@color@push! on too
% many math-mode colorings, in \!\pcol@zparacol! on illegal nesting;

% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@caption!}]
% is an internal macro to implement \!\caption!.  The original definition of
% the macro is kept in \!\pcol@ac@caption@latex!, while

% if necessary.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\end@float!}]

% request for floats or marginal notes.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@opcol!}]
% is an internal macro for \!\output! routine to output a page or to keep
% the first column until the second one is completed.  This macro is used in

% are left at \Endparacol{} and they are put in \fpage{}s.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@makecol!}]
% is an internal macro for \!\output! routine to build the ship-out
% image of a column in \!\@outputbox! consisting of top floats, main
% vertical list in \!\box!|255|, footnotes in \!\footins!, and bottom
% floats\footnote{
% 
% In p\LaTeX, the order of footnotes and bottom floats are reversed.}.
% 
% It is used in \!\pcol@output! to process a sneaked \!\output!  request
% from outside of \env{paracol}, in \!\pcol@@makecol! for a \colpage{} to be
% flushed by \!\pcol@flushcolumn! and \!\pcol@makeflushedpage!, in
% \!\pcol@makecol! for an ordinary \colpage{}, and in \!\pcol@output@start!
% and \!\pcol@makenormalcol! for \preenv{}.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@reinserts!}]
% in an internal macro for \!\output! routine to put \!\footins! and
% \!\@kludgeins! back to the main vertical list if they have something.  It

% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@textbottom!}]
% is an internal macro for \!\output! routine to be put at the bottom of
% \!\@outputbox! in which a \colpage{} is stored, by \!\@makecol!.  This
% macro is temporarily re\!\def!ined by \!\pcol@makecol! for a \colpage{}
% having \sync{}ation points so that it has a vertical skip of inifinite
% stretch and shrink to push up/down the stuff below the last \sync{}ation
% point in order to adjust its top to the point.  After that, its original
% definition kept in \!\pcol@textbottom! is restored.  Another modifiers of
% the macro are as follows; \!\pcol@makenormalcol! to make the macro
% \!\let!-equal to \!\relax! temporarily to avoid the insertion of whatever
% the macro has in \!\@makecol!; and \!\pcol@makeflushedpage! to let the
% macro have \!\vfil! temporarily so that empty columns in a \lpage{} are
% made {\em full size} without underfull.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@outputpage!}]
% is an internal macro for \!\output! routine to output a page kept in
% \!\@outputbox! together with the header and footer.  The original
% definition of this macro is saved in \!\pcol@@outputpage! to be used in
% \!\pcol@outputpage@l! and \!\pcol@outputpage@r! being calles of our own
% revised version of \!\@outputpage!.  Therefore, any \!\output! request to
% result in page ship-out reaches our own \!\@outputpage! and then \LaTeX's
% one after we perform operations for \parapag{}ing and \bgpaint{} onto the
% ship-out image.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@combinefloats!}]
% is an internal macro for \!\output! routine to combine top and bottom
% floats in \!\@toplist! and \!\@botlist! respectively with \!\@outputbox!
% in which the main vertical list and footnotes\footnote{
% 
% In p\LaTeX, footnotes are not in \cs{@outputbox} because of the reversal of
% footnotes and bottom floats.}
% 
% have been put by \!\@makecol!, and to have the result in \!\@outputbox!
% again.  In \!\pcol@zparacol!, it is made \!\let!-equal to our own
% \!\pcol@combinefloats!  so that \!\@makecol! and \!\pcol@makenormalcol!
% uses it instead of the original one.  However, if \!\pcol@output! finds
% that the \!\output!  request for a page break outside \env{paracol} is
% sneaked into our own \!\output! routine, it makes this macro \!\let!-equal
% to \!\pcol@@combinefloats! in which \LaTeX's version is kept so that
% \LaTeX's original \!\output! routine works perfectly as original.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@cflt!}]
% is an internal macro for \!\output! routine to put all top floats in
% \!\@toplist! and related stuff such as the vertical skip of
% \!\textfloatsep! into \!\@outputbox!  together with its old contents being
% the main vertical list and footnotes
% 
% \addtocounter{footnote}{-1}\footnotemark.
% 
% It is used in \!\pcol@combinefloats! if the \colpage{} being processed
% does not have \sync{}ation points.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@cflb!}]
% is an internal macro for \!\output! routine to put all bottom floats in
% \!\@botlist! and related stuff such as the vertical skip of
% \!\textfloatsep! into \!\@outputbox!  together with its old contents being

% 
% \addtocounter{footnote}{-1}\footnotemark.
% 
% It is used in \!\pcol@combinefloats!.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{$\!\@comflelt!\arg{flt}$}]
% is an internal macro for \!\output! routine to put $\arg{flt}$ being a
% \cwise{} top or bottom float to the tail of \!\@tempboxa! which
% finally has all top\slash bottom floats in a column.  It is used in
% \!\pcol@cflt! to apply it to each element of \!\@toplist!.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{$\!\@comdblflelt!\arg{flt}$}]
% is an internal macro for \!\output! routine to put $\arg{flt}$ being a
% \pwise{} float to the tail of \!\@tempboxa! which finally has the
% \spanning{} for \pwise{} floats.  It is used in \!\pcol@startpage! to
% apply to each element of \!\@dbltoplist! to have the \spanning.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@startcolumn!}]
% is an internal macro for \!\output! routine which tries to build a
% \fcolumn{} for the floats in \!\@deferlist! and, if the column
% is not built, tries to move floats to \!\@toplist! and \!\@botlist!.  This
% macro is used in \!\pcol@output! to process a sneaked \!\output! request
% from outside of \env{paracol}, and in \!\pcol@output@end! for the case
% \pwise{} floats are left at \Endparacol{} after which they become
% \cwise{} ones.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{$\!\@tryfcolumn!\arg{lst}$}]
% is an internal macro for \!\output! routine which examines if a \fcolumn{}
% or a \fpage{} can be built with some floats in $\arg{lst}$ and, if so,
% builds the page in \!\@outputbox! removing floats put in the page from
% $\arg{lst}$.  It is used in \!\pcol@startpage! for \pwise{} floats in
% \!\@dbldeferlist!, and in \!\pcol@startcolumn! for \cwise{} floats in
% $\cc_c(\dl)$.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{$\!\@scolelt!\arg{flt}$}]
% is an internal macro for \!\output! routine which examines if a
% \cwise{} float $\arg{flt}$ can be added to \!\@toplist! or
% \!\@botlist! being the list of the floats to be put at the top or bottom
% of a page respectively.  Then, if the examination succeeds, $\arg{flt}$ is
% added to \!\@toplist! or \!\@botlist!, while it is added to
% \!\@deferlist! otherwise.  It is used in \!\pcol@trynextcolumn! to
% apply to each element of (the copy of) $\cc_c(\dl)$.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{$\!\@sdblcolelt!\arg{flt}$}]
% is an internal macro for \!\output! routine which examines if a
% \pwise{} float $\arg{flt}$ can be added to \!\@dbltoplist! being the
% list of the floats to be put at the top of a page, and if so, adds
% $\arg{flt}$ to \!\@dbltoplist!, while it is added to \!\@dbldeferlist! or
% \!\@deferlist! depending on \LaTeX's version otherwise as discussed in
% item-\ref{item:ovv-float-@addtodblcol} of Section \ref{sec:imp-ovv-float}.
% It is used in \!\pcol@startpage! to apply to each element of (the copy of)
% \!\@dbldeferlist!.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@addmarginpar!}]

% \!\pcol@addmarginpar! being our own \!\@addmarginpar!.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{$\!\@makefcolumn!\arg{lst}$}]
% is an internal macro for \!\output! routine to build a \fcolumn{} with

% \end{itemize}
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@toplist!}]
% is an internal macro having the list of \cwise{} floats which is

% combined size of top floats, while \!\pcol@setcurrcol! and
% \!\pcol@igetcurrcol!  saves\slash restores the list into/from $\cc_c(\tl)$
% respectively.  In addition our macros may add an element or build the
% entire list in the following two cases.  One case is for a \sync{}ation
% for which \!\pcol@synccolumn! lets the main vertical list in
% $\cc_c(\vb^b)$ be a float, namely {\em\mvlfloat} to be added to this list.
% Another case is for a \fcolumn{} in the \lpage{} for which
% \!\pcol@makefcolumn! and \!\pcol@makefcolelt! build this list for deferred
% floats.  In the latter case, the list is scanned by \!\pcol@makefcolpage!
% invoked from \!\pcol@makefcolumn! itself, \!\pcol@flushcolumn! and
% \!\pcol@makeflushedpage!.
%

% by \!\pcol@output@start! to calculate the room for each \colpage{} in the
% \spage, and by \!\pcol@makenormalcol! to decide whether \!\@makecol! is
% used or not for building \preenv.  The list is also scanned by
% \!\pcol@measurecolumn! for the measurement of the combined size of bottom
% floats, while \!\pcol@setcurrcol! and \!\pcol@igetcurrcol! saves\slash

% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\@midlist!}]
% is an internal macro having the list of in-text floats which has already

% and \!\pcol@igetcurrcol! saves\slash restores the list into/from
% $\cc_c(\ml)$ respectively.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\f@depth!}]
% is an internal macro having |1sp| or being \!\let!-equal to \!\z@! to
% specify the float category, \pwise{} or \cwise{} respectively, which
% float-related macros work on.  As discussed in

% Section~\ref{sec:imp-ovv-float}, this feature introduced in 2015 version
% of \LaTeX{} is nullified in \env{paracol} environments and thus the
% setting with |1sp| done by \!\@dblfloatplacement! is overriden by
% \!\pcol@startpage! and \!\pcol@output@clear! when they invoke the macro.
% 
% \item[\Uidx{\!\cl@@ckpt!}]
% is an internal macro having the list of all counters defined by
% \!\newcounter! and the counter \counter{page}.  The original usage of this

% 
% \item[$\cs{cl@}{\cdot}\theta$]
% is an internal macro having the list $\clist(\theta)$ of descendant

% 
% The register \!\pcol@currcol! has the zero-origin ordinal $c$ of the
% column which we were in when \!\output! is invoked.  Therefore, for
% example, in the process of \!\switchcolumn!, the register has $c$ from
% which we are switching to another column.  The register is initialized to
% be 0 by \!\pcol@output@start!, and then set to $\!\pcol@nextcol!=d$ by
% \!\pcol@restartcolumn! to switch to (or stay in) $d$.  Note that these two
% assignments are \!\global! while other macros may {\em locally} use the
% register to, for example, scan all columns $c\In0\C$.  Besides two macros
% above, the following macros refer to the register to know which column we
% are in (or which column is processed by their invokers).

% and to pass $\LBRP0\CL$ or $\LBRP\CL\C$ to \!\pcol@swapcolumn! to

% 
% The next declaration group is for six \!\dimen! and one \!\skip!
% registers.
% 
% \begin{macro}{\pcol@prevdepth}
% The \!\dimen! register \!\pcol@prevdepth! is set to the depth of the last
% item added to the main vertical list of column $c$ from which we switch to
% another column $d$, i.e., \!\prevdepth! seen in \!\pcol@invokeoutput!
% before \!\output! request.  The value of the register is then  set into
% \!\prevdepth! also by \!\pcol@invokeoutput! after \!\output! for the
% column $d$.  The value of the register is stored in $\cc_c(\pd)$ by
% \!\pcol@setcurrcol! and then restored into the register by
% \!\pcol@igetcurrcol! for the use in \!\pcol@invokeoutput! above and in
% \!\pcol@measurecolumn!, which may let the register and $\cc_c(\pd)$ have
% $\infty$ if the \colpage{} $c$ is empty.  The register is also updated by
% \!\pcol@synccolumn! for empty main vertical list case, and by
% \!\pcol@output@end!  to be set into \!\prevdepth! for the first vertical
% item of \postenv.
% \end{macro}
% 
% \begin{macro}{\pcol@colht}
% The \!\dimen! register \!\pcol@colht! has $\VPP$ being the height of the
% tallest column in the \lpage{} taking \!\textfloatsep! below bottom floats
% into account if any.  The register is initialized to be $-\!\maxdimen!$ by
% \!\pcol@sync! and then is examined and updated in \!\pcol@measurecolumn!
% to find the tallest column.  Besides the internal use of this exploration,
% its result is referred to by \!\pcol@sync! as the threshold of \pfcheck,
% and by \!\pcol@makeflushedpage! through its argument given by
% \!\pcol@output@end! to know the height of multi-column stuff in the
% \lpage{}.  The macro \!\pcol@makeflushedpage! also lets the register have
% 0 if the \lpage{} has nothing but non-\mgfnote{} \Scfnote{}.  The other
% usage of this register is in \!\pcol@freshpage! to keep the value of
% \!\@colht! of the page made by \!\flushpage! or \!\clearpage! so that it
% is given to $\!\@colroom!=\cc_c(\vb^r)$ of each column $c$ in case a
% column $c'$ s.t.\ $c'<c$ made another page for \fcolumn{}s updating
% \!\@colht!.

% 
% \begin{macro}{\pcol@textfloatsep}
% \changes{v1.0}{2011/10/10}
%	{Introduced for the bug fix of float space enlargement.}
% 
% The \!\dimen! (not \!\skip!) register \!\pcol@textfloatsep! has
% \!\maxdimen! if a \colpage{} does not have \sync{}ation points, to let top
% floats are inserted in usual way.  If it has, the register may hold the
% vertical space amount inserted after top floats in a \colpage{} instead of
% \!\textfloatsep! so that, if a column only with top floats defines the
% first \sync{}ation point, the space for floats are extended to the
% \sync{}ation point.  In this extension case, the register has the amount
% above biased by 10000\,|pt| to distinguish the case from another case with
% ordinary top floats in which the register has non-biased \!\textfloatsep!.
% In addition, if the register is less than \!\maxdimen! including a value
% equal to \!\textfloatsep!, top floats are packed in a \!\vbox! so that
% stretch\slash shrink factor of \!\floatsep!  cannot move \sync{}ation
% points.  After the default setting to be \!\maxdimen! by \!\pcol@zparacol!
% and \!\pcol@floatplacement!, the value of the register is stored in
% $\cc_c(\tf)$ by \!\pcol@setcurrcol! and then restored into the register by
% \!\pcol@igetcurrcol! for the use in \!\pcol@makecol!,
% \!\pcol@combinefloats!, \!\pcol@cflt!, \!\pcol@output@switch!,

% 
% The \!\dimen! register \!\pcol@lrmargin! is let have

% \!\linewidth! for column $c$ is let have $\w_c-\lrm$ by
% \!\pcol@invokeoutput!, which also sets \!\parshape! if $\lrm>0$.
% 
% The other usage of this register is to have the left or right margin for

% have the list of deferred footnotes.  The register is made void by
% \!\pcol@output@start! and then is made grown by \!\pcol@fntextother!  with
% a deferred footnote added by the macro.  The macro

% through \!\footins! but may keep some of trailing ones in it if the total
% height of the footnotes is too large, while \!\pcol@output@end! does the
% \!\insert!ion without height capping.  The macro \!\endparacol! with
% non-\mgfnote{} \Scfnote{} typesetting also refers to the register to pass
% it to \!\pcol@flushclear! as its argument so as to make an explicit page
% break if the register has some deferred footnotes.

% \begin{macro}{\pcol@prespan}
% \changes{v1.3-1}{2013/09/17}

% 
% The \!\box! register \!\pcol@prespan! keeps the \prespan{} during a
% \mctext{} is processed by \TeX{} and our own \!\output! routine.  That is, 
% the macro \!\pcol@putbackmvl! saves the contents $\cc_0(\vb^b)$ of
% the column 0 to be restarted into the register instead of putting it back
% to the main vertical list, or makes the register $\bot$ if the column has
% nothing, when the restart follows the \sync{}ation with
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@sptextstart}=\true$.  Then the contents of the register
% is put back to the main vertical list together with the box having
% \mctext{} after its vertical size is registered in the list $\pp^s(p)$ of

% work on the register together with \!\@outputbox! for

% it, or to make the register $\bot$ when it have an empty \lpage{} but with
% \spanning{} of \pwise{} floats.  After closing a \env{paracol}
% environment, the contents of the register 
% will be shiped out by
% \!\@outputpage! invoked outside \env{paracol} environment when the
% \postenv{} sees a page break, or referred to by \!\pcol@output@start! as
% the \preenv{} in the right \parapag{}e.  This right \preenv{} then will be
% combined with \colpage{}s in the right \parapag{}e by \!\pcol@ioutputelt!
% or \!\pcol@imakeflushedpage! for shipping-out, or by

% Another debugging tool is for investigating memory leak problems.  Since
% \Paracol{} uses \!\insert! registers for various purposes, management
% operations of them especially that for proper release of them are crusial
% for the correctness of the implmentation.  A source of toughness in
% debugging {\em memory leak} caused by missing a release of a register back
% to \!\@freelist! is that the resulting shortage is revealed long after the
% leakage to make it hard to find the point of the leakage.
% 
% The set of macros is to help such debugging by logging the aquire and
% release of \!\insert! registers into a file named $\arg{job}|.fls|$
% associated with \!\pcol@F@write! where $\arg{job}$ is given by

% The macro \!\pcol@output! is the \Paracol's version of \!\output! which

% 
% $\!\@startcolumn!\to\!\pcol@startcolumn!$ to creat a new \colpage{}.  The
% argument \!\@ne! is to distinguish the invocation in this macro from
% that in \!\pcol@freshpage! so that the \!\insert!ions of $\pp^f(p)$ and
% $\df$ are done only when a new \colpage{} is created with ordinary page
% break.

%	{Add $\cs{ifpcol@sptextstart}\EQ\string\mathit{false}$ to the
%	 condition for the warning of too small \cs{vsize}.}
% 
% In addition, before we start the main body of \!\output! routine, we add
% two operations for coloring.  One is to make
% \!\set@color! \!\let!-equal to \!\pcol@set@color!, i.e, to let it regain
% its original definition throughout \!\output! routine, because
% no manipulation of \colorstack{} is necessary\footnote{
% 
% Though this operation is not necessary because \cs{everyvbox} should work
% for any \cs{set@color} because they should be in a \cs{vbox}, we dare to
% do it for clearity.}.
% 
% The other is to zero-clear the counter \!\pcol@mcid! because we are
% definitely in the main (non-internal) vertical mode and thus all requests
% must have been processed or will have to be processed before the next
% coloring in math mode.
% 
% Further, before we start the sequence for non-special \!\output!  request
% on page breaks, we examine if $\CSIndex{ifpcol@output}=\true$ to mean
% \!\pcol@output@start! has already been invoked in order to cope with
% \!\output! request {\em sneaking}.  This sneaking happens when
% \beginparacol{} is at a crtical position of page breaking at which the
% \preenv{} has already exceeds \!\vsize! but \TeX{} cannot make the
% \!\output! request for the page break at \CSIndex{par} at the beginning of
% \!\pcol@zparacol! because it sees $\!\penalty!=10000$ due to, e.g., a
% sectioning command just preceding \beginparacol.  In this case, the
% request is postponed until \TeX{} see a \!\penalty! less than 10000 and
% thus it is made with some non-special \!\outputpenalty! greather than
% $-10000$ when \TeX{} sees the dummy request of $\!\penalty!=-10004$ in
% \!\pcol@invokeoutput! for \!\pcol@output@start!.  At this timing,
% \!\pcol@zparacol! has already let \!\output! have \!\pcol@output! of
% course but the request must be processed by original \!\output! because it
% is made {\em outside} of the \env{paracol} environment which has just
% started.  Therefore, if $\CSIndex{ifpcol@output}=\false$, we have to
% perform the operation sequence as the original \!\output! does.
% Furthermore, we have to take care of the fact that a few our own settings
% related to \!\output!  routine has already been made in \!\pcol@zparacol!,
% namely $\CSIndex{if@twocolumn}=\true$ and
% $\!\@combinefloats!=\!\pcol@combinefloats!$, which should make the macros
% in the original sequnce confused especially by the former.  Therefore, we
% turns $\CSIndex{if@twocolumn}=\false$ and let \!\@combinefloats! have the
% original definition kept in \!\pcol@@combinefloats!\footnote{
% 
% Though we know \cs{pcol@combinefloats} acts exactly as \cs{@combinefloats}
% because \cs{pcol@zparacol} initializes $\cs{pcol@textfloatsep}=\infty$ and
% $\cs{ifpcol@lastpage}=\false$.  On the other hand, we don't cancel the
% re\cs{def}itnition of \cs{footnoterule} because it should be
% $\cs{textwidth}=\cs{columnwidth}$ outside of \env{paracol} environments.}
% 
% temporarily, i.e., only in the group automatically surrounding the
% invocation of \!\output!.
% 
% Another addition is to assign \!\@maxdepth! to \!\maxdepth! in order to
% nullify the temporary setting to 0 done in \!\@addtobot!.  By this
% assignment, in \env{paracol} environments \TeX's page builder always
% refers to the value in \!\@maxdepth!.  Yet another addition is to add
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@sptextstart}=\false$ to the condition for the warning of
% too short \!\vsize!, because a \mctext{} can start near the bottom of a
% page with a small \!\@colroom! less than $1.5\times\!\baselineskip!$ and
% thus the warning is unnecessary and inappropriate when
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@sptextstart}=\true$.

% The macro \!\pcol@makecol! is invoked solely from \!\pcol@output! to build
% the shipping image of the \ccolpage{} which just has completed in
% \!\@outputbox!.  This macro has two additional functions to its original
% version \!\@makecol!\footnote{
% 
% Not \cs{pcol@@makecol} because the depth capping of \cs{@outputbox} is
% done by \cs{pcol@opcol} when it saves the box into $\cc_c(\vb^b)$.}
% 
% invoked in this macro.
% 
% First, if $\cc_c(\tf)\neq\infty$ to mean the \colpage{} has \sync{}ation
% points, \!\@makecol! is invoked with a special \!\def!inition of
% \!\@textbottom! to put a vertical skip having $1/10000\,|fil|$ as its
% stretch and shrink.  This modification is to nullify not only finite
% stretches (as \!\raggedbottom! does) but also finite shrinks possibly
% inserted just below the last \sync{}ation point to move up the first
% visible item upward a little bit if active.  Therefore, \!\flushbottom!
% setting is nullified for \colpage{}s having \sync{}ation points and a
% small exceess from the bottom of a \colpage{} cannot be absorbed by
% shrinks but visible at the bottom\footnote{
% 
% That is, the author gives higher priority to the perfect alignment of the
% items following a \sync{}ation point.}.
% 
% Note that the original definition of \!\@textbottom! is saved in
% \Midx{\!\pcol@textbottom!} before the invocation of \!\@makecol! and is
% restored after that\footnote{
% 
% This save/restore cannot be done by a grouping because \!\@makecol! builds
% \!\@outputbox! by local assignments.}.
% 
% Second, if $\CSIndex{pcol@sptext}=\true$ and $c=0$ to mean a \mctext{}
% encounters a page break, we have the first half (or second or succeeding
% part if the text lays across three or more pages) of the text in
% \!\box!|255|.  Therefore, we add an element $\spt(H_n,h_n)$ to the tail of
% the list of \mctext{}s $\pp^s(\ptop)=\!\pcol@sptextlist!$, where $H_n$ is
% the height of \prespan{} in \!\pcol@prespan!\footnote{
% 
% Since we have a \sync{}ation point before a \mctext{} always, \prespan{}
% or its sole contents \cs{vbox} has a vertical skip at its tail to make the
% its depth 0 as discussed in \secref{sec:imp-sout-sync}.}
% 
% plus the total height of top floats calculated by \!\pcol@addflhd! with
% $\cc_c(\tl)=\!\@toplist!$, and $h_n$ is the height-plus-depth of
% \!\box!|255|.  Note that $H_n$ and $h_n$ are represented in the form of
% integer and thus we produce them by expansions with \!\number!.
% 
% The addition, however, is not made if $h_n=0$ because painting its
% \bground{} is harmful if an extension is specified to make the region
% visible, while not painting or drawing a segment of \cseprule{} is very
% natural.  Note that this $h_n=0$ case includes that in which \!\box!|255|
% has nothing but its height-plus-depth is non-zero because of discarding
% leading skips of the \mctext{} as pre-break skips.  This special case is
% detected by decapsulating \!\box!|255| by \!\unvcopy!  and examining the
% height-plus-depth of the result\footnote{
% 
% We cannot do
% \cs{setbox}\cs{@cclv}\cs{vbox}\texttt{\Arg{\cs{unvbox}\cs{@cclv}}}
% because it erases the effect of pre-break skip following some visible
% material.}.
% 
% Also note that the list to be added is always for the \tpage{}, i.e.,
% $\pp^s(\ptop)$ and thus we get and update it by \!\pcol@getcurrpinfo! and
% \!\pcol@defcurrpage!, because the \mctext{} immediately follows a
% \sync{}ation point in $\ptop$.  Then we let \!\box!|255| have the
% \prespan{} followed by the \mctext{} being the original contents of
% \!\box!|255|, which may be shifted left by
% $\WT-w_c=\!\textwidth!-\!\columnwidth!$ if \cswap{} is in effect so that
% its left edge is aligned to that of the leftmost column, i.e., of the text
% area.
% 
% The third addition is for \Scfnote{}s.  If they are presented in
% \!\footins!, we shrink \!\@colht! by its height plus depth
% by \!\pcol@shrinkcolbyfn! and put the stretch and shrink factor of
% \!\skip!\!\footins! at the bottom of \!\box!|255| by \!\pcol@unvbox@cclv!
% to {\em remove} footnotes from the \colpage{} but keeping the
% stretch\slash shrink contribution to the page breaking by their existence.
% Then we save \!\footins! into a new \!\insert! to be referred to as
% \!\pcol@currfoot!\footnote{
% 
% Not in \cs{pcol@footins} because it is destroyed in \cs{pcol@startpage}
% just before saving operation into $\pp^f(p)$.}
% 
% by \!\pcol@savefootins! if $p=\ptop$ so that it is saved in $\pp^f(p)$ by
% \!\pcol@startpage! afterward, or simply discard the contents of
% \!\footins! otherwise because $\pp^f(p)$ has already been fixed.  Note
% that these saving\slash discarding make \!\footins! void and thus
% \!\@makecol! will not put footnotes.

% The macro \!\pcol@combinefloats! is our own version of \!\@combinefloats!
% is used in \LaTeX's \!\@makecol! because the original and our
% own are made \!\let!-equal by \!\pcol@zparacol!, and in
% \!\pcol@makenormalcol!  explicitly.  The customization is twofold for both
% of top and bottom floats.
% 
% For the top floats, we invoke the original \!\@cflt! if
% $\cc_c(\tf)=\infty$ to mean the \colpage{} to be shipped out does not have
% \sync{}ation points, or otherwise our own \!\pcol@cflt! which we will
% discuss shortly.  Prior to the invocation of \!\@cflt!, in addition, we
% let $\!\maxdepth!=\!\@maxdepth!$ so that the macro refers to the value used
% throughout a \env{paracol} environment instead of that modified by
% \!\@addtobot! possibly affect the work in \!\@cflt! by the following
% sequence.

% \!\pcol@flushcolumn!(c)&\to&\!\pcol@trynextcolumn!\to\cdots\to\!\@addtobot!\\
% &\to&\!\pcol@flushcolumn!(c{+}k)\to\!\pcol@@makecol!\to\!\@makecol!\\
% &\to&\!\pcol@combinefloats!\to\!\@cflt!
% \end{eqnarray*}
%
% For the bottom floats, we invoke the original \!\@cflb! always but, if
% the \colpage{} has \sync{}ation points, we insert vertical skips of
% $s=0\,|pt|\ |plus|\ 0.0001\,|fil|\ |minus|\ 0.0001\,|fil|$ and $-s$ before
% and after the invocation respectively.  Since \!\@textbottom! is let have
% the skip of $s$ by \!\pcol@makecol! for a \colpage{} having \sync{}ation
% points and is inserted below bottom floats by \!\@makecol!\footnote{
% 
% The insertion point is common to \LaTeX{} and p\LaTeX{}.},
% 
% the effect of \!\@textbottom! is canceled by the skip of $-s$ but looks
% moved above bottom floats.  Therefore, if the natural height of the
% \colpage{} is smaller than \!\@colht!, bottom floats are flushed to the
% page bottom as if \colpage{} itself is flushed by \!\newpage! etc.  On the
% other hand, if the natural height is larger, more importantly, all shrinks
% below the last \sync{}ation point is canceled by the infinite shrink in
% $s$ above the bottom float but we should have sufficient space for shrinks
% there thanks to \!\textfloatsep! to avoid the interference between the
% bottom text and bottom floats.
% 
% In addition, if $\CSIndex{ifpcol@lastpage}=\true$ to mean the \colpage{} is
% in the \lpage{}, we insert \!\textfloatsep! in \!\@outputbox! below the
% bottom floats so that they are well separated from \postenv.  The switch
% is also $\true$ in the invocation from \!\pcol@makenormalcol! for
% \preenv{}, so that the bottom floats in it are well separated from the top
% of multi-column stuff in the \spage.
% 
% On the other hand, the original \!\@combinefloats! saved in
% \!\pcol@@combinefloats! by \!\pcol@zparacol! is used in \!\pcol@output! to
% restore the original when it finds \!\output! request sneaking.

% The macro \!\pcol@cflt! is invoked solely from \!\pcol@combinefloats! if
% the \colpage{} for which the macro combines the top floats has
% \sync{}ation points.  The macro has the same structure as \LaTeX's version
% \!\@cflt! but has three modifications.  The first one is that the floats
% are packed in a \!\vbox! rather than listed in \!\@outputbox! to nullify
% the stretch and shrink of \!\floatsep! to keep the \sync{}ation point from
% moving by them\footnote{
% 
% Maybe unnecessary because of \!\@textbottom! inserted by \!\pcol@makecol!
% but \ldots}.
% 
% The second is that we use \!\@maxdepth! instead of \!\maxdepth! to make it
% clear we always use the value common throughout a \env{paracol}
% environment.  The third is that the \!\textfloatsep! is replaced with
% $\!\pcol@textfloatsep!=\cc_c(\tf)$ (definitely finite) which can have a
% value different from \!\textfloatsep! when the float space is enlarged for
% \sync{}ation.  If this enlargement is required, $\cc_c(\tf)$ is biased by
% 10000\,|pt| and thus is assuredly\footnote{
% 
% Though not definitely in theoretical sense.}
% 
% larger than 5000\,|pt|.  If so, the insertion of \!\topfigrule! should be
% inhibited because it has already been inserted by \!\pcol@synccolumn! or
% there are no real floats but we only have the float for main vertical list

% 
% \SpecialArrayIndex{c}{\pcol@shipped}

% by \!\@cons!.  In this saving operation, we add the sequence of uncoloring

% possibly coloring \!\special!s for the \colpage{}'s \colorctext{} saved in
% $\csts$ at the top, so that the succeeding \colpage{} in printing order
% starts with its own \colorctext.  For this addition, furthermore, we let
% $\!\boxmaxdepth!=\!\@maxdepth!$ to keep the depth capping made in the box
% builder from nullified\footnote{
% 
% Or to apply the capping dropped from p\LaTeX's \cs{@makecol}, or to do
% nothing for the box made by \cs{@tryfcolumn} and thus being 0 deep.}.
% 
% Then if $c=0$, we fix the page number of the page $p$ having the
% \colpage{} and let $\pp^p(q)$ have $\page(p)+(q-p)$ usually but possibly
% $\page(p)+2(q-p)$ with \npaired{} \parapag{}ing, for all

% $\pbase$ and its successor \fpage{}s.

% The macro \!\pcol@startpage! is invoked from \!\pcol@opcol! with

% from \!\pcol@output@start! with a too large \preenv{} or
% \!\pcol@freshpage! with $\!\pcol@currpage!=|{}|$ and $\!\c@page!=\page(p)$
% to start a new page $p=0$.
% 
% First, we let $\!\pcol@firstprevdepth!=\!\relax!$ to mean we have (had)
% left from the \spage{} so that \!\pcol@output@end! will be informed of
% that.  Next we let $\ptop=p$ and then, if invoked from \!\pcol@opcol!,
% obtain $\pp^p(p{-}1)$ by \!\pcol@getcurrpinfo! to have $\page(p{-}1)$ in

% $\pp^f(p{-}1)=\!\pcol@currfoot!$ into which \!\pcol@makecol! saved

% by \!\stepcounter!.  Then we let $\!\@colht!=\!\textheight!$ as the base
% value without \spanning, and $\!\topskip!=\!\pcol@topskip!$ because the

% The macro $\!\pcol@buildcolseprule!\<H_{n+1}\>\<\Cfrom\>\<\Cto\>\<d\>$ is
% used in \!\pcol@ioutputelt!, \!\pcol@imakeflushedpage! and
% \!\pcol@iflushfloats!  to build a box containing \cseprule{} possibly
% broken by \mctext{}s and to paint \bground{}s of columns and \csepgap{}s
% for $c\In\Cfrom\Cto$ and \mctext{}s in the \lpage{} ($d=0$) or non-last
% page ($d=\!\@maxdepth!$) $p$ having \colpage{}s of $H_{n+1}$ tall where
% $n=\Abs{\pp^s(p)}$.
% 
% For initializing the drawing and painting process, we let
% $\!\@tempdimb!=H_0+h_0=0$,
% $(\!\pcol@bg@from!,\!\pcol@bg@to!)=(\CBfrom,\CBto)=(\Cfrom,\Cto)$, and
% make boxes $b_r=\!\pcol@tempbox!$ for the rule and $b_b=\!\@tempboxa!$ for
% the \bground{} empty.  Then we apply
% \!\pcol@buildcselt@S!$\<H_i\>\<h_i\>$ to each element $\spt(H_i,h_i)$ of
% $\pp^s(p)$ to under-paint the \bground{} of each \mctext{} by
% \!\pcol@bg@paintbox! defining its region $\bgr_S(i)$ by letting their top

% \mctext{} is non-last, or $(H_{n+1}-H_i)+d$ if last to fill the narrow
% strip of $d=\!\@maxdepth!$ tall below the text for non-\lpage{}s.
% 
% Then we scan $\pp^s(p)$ again but applying
% $\!\pcol@buildcselt!\~\<H_i\>\<h_i\>$ to each element $\spt(H_i,h_i)$ to
% do the followings.
% 
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item
% To $b_r$, add a vertical rule whose height is $H'_i=H_i-(H_{i-1}+h_{i-1})$
% and width is \!\columnseprule! if $H'_i>0$, and then a vertical skip of
% $h_i$, as the rule segment between $(i{-}1)$-th and $i$-th \mctext{}s.
% Note that $H_i$ and $h_i$ are represented in the form of integers and thus
% we need |sp| to use them as dimensions.
% 
% \item
% To $b_b$, add painted \bground{}s for all columns $c\In\Cfrom\Cto$ and
% \csepgap{}s $c\In\Cfrom{\Cto{-}1}$ by \!\pcol@bg@paintcolumns! defining
% their regions $\bgr_{\{c,g\}}^c(i)$ by letting common top edge position
% $y_0=\!\pcol@bg@columntop!=H_{i-1}+h_{i-1}$ and common height
% $y_1-y_0=\!\pcol@bg@columnheight!=H'_i$, if $H'_i>0$.  Also add painted
% \bground{} for the $i$-th \mctext{} by \!\pcol@bg@paintbox! as we did for
% under-painting but this time the region is $\bgr_s(i)$.
% 
% \item
% Let $\!\@tempdimb!=H_i+h_i$ for the next element $\spt(H_{i+1},h_{i+1})$.
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% Then if $H'_{n+1}>0$, we add the last rule segment of $H'_{n+1}$ tall to
% $b_r$, and add painted \bground{}s for columns and \csepgap{}s as done in
% the step\Tie2 above but letting $y_1-y_0=H'_{n+1}+d$ to let the common

% 
% The macro \!\@outputpage!, being our own version of \LaTeX's one kept in
% \!\pcol@@outputpage!, ships out a page $p$ or \parapag{}e pair in $p$.
% The reason why we redefine this macro is that we need a few special
% operations for \parapag{}ing and \bgpaint{} {\em outside} of \env{paracol}
% environments.  Therefore, the macro is not only used in our own macros
% \!\pcol@outputelt!, \!\pcol@output@start!, \!\pcol@output@flush!,
% \!\pcol@output@clear!, \!\pcol@flushfloats! and \!\pcol@output@end!, but
% also in \LaTeX's \!\@opcol! and \!\@doclearpage!\footnote{
% 
% And possibly in \CSIndex{@outputdblcol} if double-column typesetting is
% done outside \env{paracol}.}
% 
% invoked from our own or \LaTeX's \!\output! routine.
% 
% First we calculate $H'_M=\!\topmargin!+\!\headheight!+\!\headsep!$ to place
% the origin of \bgpaint{} at the top edge of text area in what \LaTeX{}
% assumes as a page, i.e., shifted 1\,inch down from the real page.  Then if
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@output}=\true$ to mean this macro is used in a
% \env{paracol} environment, we build the painted \bground{}s of left and
% right \parapag{}es in $\!\pcol@tempbox!=b_l$ and $\!\@tempboxa!=b_r$ by
% putting a vertical skip of $H'_M$, and invoking \!\pcol@bg@paintpage!
% with the setting $(\!\pcol@bg@from!,\!\pcol@bg@to!)=(\CBfrom,\CBto)$ be
% $(0,\CL)$ and $(\CL,\C)$ respectively.  Note that \!\pcol@bg@paintpage!
% paints \bground{}s of regions $\bgr_a^{[c]}$ for all
% $a\in\{T,B,L,R,C,S,t,b,l,r\}$ and $c\In\CBfrom\CBto$, and for $b_r$ we
% temporarily increment $\page(p)$ by one if \npaired{} \parapag{}ing is in
% effect.
% 
% Otherwise, i.e., if $\CSIndex{ifpcol@output}=\false$ indicating outside
% use, we build the painted \bground{}s in $b_l$ and $b_r$ similarly but
% with the following differences;  \bgpaint{} is done if
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@havelastpage}=\true$ to mean the page to be shipped has
% the \lpage{} of closed \env{paracol} as its part and
% $\!\set@color!\neq\!\relax!$ to mean some coloring package is loaded;
% page \bground{} painting is done by \!\pcol@bg@@paintpage! because
% \!\pcol@bg@paintpage! is not available outside \env{paracol} environments;
% the \bground{} of \postenv{} is painted by \!\pcol@bg@@paintbox! for the
% region $\bgr_{\{P,p\}}=[(0,\WT)(\HB,\HT)]$ where
% $\HB=\!\pcol@bg@preposttop!
% \in\{\!\pcol@bg@preposttop@left!,\!\pcol@bg@preposttop@right!\}$
% having the bottom edge of the last 
% \env{paracol} environment (having right \parapag{}e for $b_r$).  In
% addition, we examine if $\!\pcol@rightpage!\neq\bot$ to mean the right
% \parapag{}e was built by \!\pcol@output@end! when the last \env{paracol}
% environment was closed and, if so, make the box \!\textheight! tall adding
% \!\vfil! to its bottom.
% 
% Then regardless of \CSIndex{ifpcol@output}, we do the followings; let the
% height and depth of $b_l$ and $b_r$ be 0 because they cannot occupy any
% real spaces in the ship-out image; temporarily let
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@swapcolumn}=\false$ if $\page(p)$ is odd, $\CL=\C$ to
% mean \parapag{}ing is not in effect\footnote{
% 
% Since the assignments of $\CL$ and $\C$ in \CSIndex{pcol@zparacol} are
% \CSIndex{global} and they are not nodified anywhere else, examining their
% equality outside \env{paracol} environments is safe and meaningful.},
% 
% \parapag{}ing is done in \npaired{} mode\footnote{
% 
% We need this examination because $\CSIndex{ifpcol@swapcolumn}=\false$ for
% \npaired{} \parapag{}ing is made locally by \!\pcol@zparacol!.},
% 
% or we are outside \env{paracol} environments and the page does not have
% anything produced in environments.  That is, we let
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@swapcolumn}=\true$ if the page has something produced by
% a \env{paracol} environment, \cswap{} and \parapag{}ing are specified for
% the (last) environment\footnote{
% 
% Column-swapping may be enabled {\em after} the last \env{paracol}
% environment was closed but we consider the enablement is effective for the
% page having the environment.},
% 
% and the page number is even.  Note that a page may have two or more
% (\lpage{}s of) \env{paracol} environements whose \parapag{}ing style can
% be inconsistent including the case some of them are not \parapag{}ed.  If
% this inconsistency happens the page is shipped out following the style of
% the last environment.  Also note that even if the last environment is not
% \parapag{}ed, the right \parapag{}e kept in \!\pcol@rightpage! is assuredly
% shipped out.
% 
% Then if \cswap{} is in effect, we ship out the right \parapag{}e at first
% by \!\pcol@outputpage@r! and then the left one by \!\pcol@outputpage@l! to
% swap the left and right.  Otherwise, the ship-out order is normal and thus
% the invocation order is \!\pcol@outputpage@l!  then \!\pcol@outputpage@r!.
% Note that if \npaired{} \parapag{}ing is in effect, the page number to
% given to \!\pcol@outputpage@r! as its argument is $\page(p)+1$ if it is
% the second one, i.e., not swapped, while the argument in other cases and
% of \!\pcol@outputpage@l! are always $\page(p)$.  Then finally, we
% \!\global!ly let $\CSIndex{ifpcol@havelastpage}=\false$ because so far the
% next page does not have \env{paracol}'s \lpage{} especially when we are
% outside it, let \!\pcol@bg@preposttop@left! and
% \!\pcol@bg@preposttop@right! have 0 because, if we are outside, the next
% \preenv{} should start from the top of a page, and let
% $\mpbout=\!\pcol@mparbottom@out!$ be $\mpboutz=\!\pcol@mparbottom@zero!$
% because so far we have no marginal notes given in \env{paracol}
% environments\footnote{
% 
% This assignment in a \env{paracol} environment is meaningless because
% $\mpbout$ is meaningless too, but not harmful.}.

% 
% The macro $\!\pcol@outputpage@l!\arg{page}$, used solely in our own
% version of \!\@outputpage!, at first lets \!\c@page! have $\arg{page}$
% which definitely has the value that \!\c@page! had when we start
% \!\@outputpage!.  That is, even when this macro is invoked after
% \!\pcol@outputpage@r! due to swapped \parapag{}ing,
% 
% \Index{column-swapping}
% 
% this assignment cancels the increment of \!\c@page! done in \LaTeX's
% \!\@outputpage! or in other word \!\pcol@@outputpage! because in this case
% \parapag{}es are \paired{}.  Then we make \!\@themargin! \!\let!-equal to
% \!\evensidemargin! if two-side typesetting is in effect and \!\c@page! is
% even, or to \!\oddsidemargin! otherwise for the reference in
% \!\pcol@outputpage@ev! as shown shortly.
% 
% Next, if \bgpaint{} took place in \!\@outputpage!, we let \!\everyvbox!
% have the macro invocation $\!\pcol@outputpage@ev!\<b_l\>$ to be expanded
% to the following sequence so that they are the leading materials in the
% \!\vbox! to be \!\shipout!; examination if the document is processed by a
% Japanese \LaTeX{} named p\LaTeX{} and then, if so, a control sequence
% \!\yoko! to put materials naturally; the painted \bground{} $b_l$ shifted
% right by \!\@themargin!; \!\nointerlineskip!  to inhibit \!\baselineskip!
% insertion after $b_l$; emptying \!\everyvbox! to ensure nothing will be
% inserted into internal \!\vbox!es; and the assignment of \!\yoko! to
% \!\let! it be \!\relax! if necessary.  This trick with \!\everyvbox! is
% necessary\footnote{
% 
% Unless we rewrite \CSIndex{@outputpage}.}
% 
% because $b_l$ should be put {\em before} \!\pcol@@outputpage! puts the
% page header, or the header would be overlaid by regions, e.g.,
% $\bgr_{\{t,T\}}$ in natural cases.
% 
% The tricky elements to handle \!\yoko! in the sequence is necessary for
% p\LaTeX{} whose \!\@outputpage! has \!\yoko! as the first element of the
% \!\vbox! to be \!\shipout!, because \!\yoko! must be the first element of
% a box but our \!\everyvbox! to put \bground{} would make it non-first.
% That is by the tricky elements, the \!\vbox! should have \!\yoko! as the
% first element from \!\everyvbox! and then that put by p\LaTeX's
% \!\@outputpage! is nullified by \!\let!\!\yoko!\!\relax! in the
% \!\everyvbox! just for the \!\vbox! to be shipped out.  On the other hand
% in ordinary \LaTeX, \!\yoko! does not appear in the \!\vbox! or is
% modified.  The examination of the use of p\LaTeX{} is also trickily done
% by comparing the expansion results of \!\meaning!\!\yoko! and
% \!\string!\!\yoko!.  Since the former results in the tokens ``\!\yoko!''
% which \!\string!\!\yoko!  gives us iff \!\yoko! is a primitive of
% underlying \TeX{} being p\TeX{} if so, the comparison should give us
% equality iff p\LaTeX{} is in use\footnote{
% 
% Unless some other \TeX{} has a primitive named \CSIndex{yoko}.  This
% examination is more strict than that with \CSIndex{pfmtname} for
% \CSIndex{ifpcol@bfbottom}.}.
% 
% Then we invoke \!\pcol@@outputpage! being (p)\LaTeX's original version of
% \!\@outputpage! to ship out \!\@outputbox! finally.
% 
% The macro \!\pcol@outputpage@r!$\arg{page}$ performs similar operations but
% it does them only when $\!\pcol@rightpage!\neq\bot$ to mean we are in an
% \env{paracol} environment with \parapag{}ing or outside it but in the page
% in which it resides.  Other differences are as follows; $\arg{page}$ can
% be $\page(p)+1$ for \npaired{} right \parapag{}es; \!\@outputbox! is
% locally made \!\let!-equal to \!\pcol@rightpage! prior to the invocation
% of \!\pcol@@outputpage!; and $b_r$ is given to \!\pcol@outputpage@ev! as

% 
% The macro $\!\pcol@startcolumn!\arg{f}$ is invoked from \!\pcol@output!
% with $f=1$ and \!\pcol@freshpage! with $f=0$ to start a new \colpage.
% This macro has two additional functions to \LaTeX's \!\@startcolumn!, one
% for \Scfnote{}s and the other for coloring.
% 
% First, if the page $p$ in which the new \colpage{} resides has \Scfnote{}s
% in $\pp^f(p)=\!\pcol@footins!$ because the column is not the leading one,
% 
% \Index{leading column}
% 
% we temporarily shrink \!\@colht! and \!\@colroom! by the space required to
% put $\pp^f(p)$ by \!\pcol@shrinkcolbyfn! during the trial of deferred
% float placement, remembering the existence of the footnotes by letting
% $\!\@tempdimb!=-\!\skip!\!\pcol@footins!$ which should be 0 otherwise.
% This shrinkage is essentially required when $p<\ptop$ because $\pp^f(p)$
% has been fixed to be a part of $p$ and thus deferred floats cannot push
% footnotes down to succeeding pages.  In the case of $p=\ptop$, the
% shrinkage is also desirable to avoid unnecessary pushing down of footnotes
% which \TeX{} has decided to be in $p$.
% 
% Then after trying put deferred floats in the \colpage{} by \!\@tryfcolumn!
% and \!\pcol@trynextcolumn! as done in \LaTeX's \!\@startcolumn!, we
% \!\insert! $\pp^f(p)$, if it is has some footnoes, by letting \!\footins!
% have it by \!\pcol@getcurrfoot! so that \TeX{} will be aware of the
% footnotes when it examines the page break of the \colpage{}.  That is, if
% $p<\ptop$ the \!\insert!ion is to keep the vertical space for $\pp^f(p)$ in
% the building process of the \colpage{} in $p$ because any \Scfnote{s}
% cannot be added to $p$ any more, and thus $\pp^f(p)$ is preserved until
% the page $p$ is shipped out.  On the other hand if $p=\ptop$, \Scfnote{s}
% in $p$ can grow further and thus \!\insert!ed footnotes will be captured
% again by \!\pcol@output@switch! or \!\pcol@startpage!.  Therefore, if
% $p=\ptop$, we release $\pp^f(p)$ to \!\@freelist!.
% 
% Then if $p=\ptop$, we also \!\insert! deferred footnotes in $\df$ until
% their total height reaches \!\@colht! by \!\pcol@deferredfootins! if $f=1$
% to mean this macro is invoked from \!\pcol@output!\footnote{
% 
% The \cs{insert}ion of $\pp^f(p)$ also requiers $f=1$ but this examination
% is redundant because $\pp^f(p)=\bot$ definately if $f=0$.}.
% 
% Note that the deferred footnote \!\insert!ion in the case of $f=0$ will
% be done afterward when \!\pcol@freshpage! does \!\pcol@restartcolumn! at
% its tail.  Also note that \!\pcol@deferredfootins! examines if
% $\!\@tempdimb!=0$ to mean $\pp^f(p)=\bot$ and thus \!\skip!\!\footins!
% should be taken into account in its extraction of the footnotes from $\df$.
% 
% Then after restoring \!\@colht! and canceling the temporary shrinkage of
% \!\@colroom!, we invoke \!\pcol@savecolorstack! to save \colpage{}'s
% \colorctext{} into $\csts$ so that coloring \!\special!s to reestablish
% $\csts$ will be put at its top if it has something when we leave it.

% The macro \!\pcol@bg@paintcolumns! is used in \!\pcol@buildcolseprule! and

% The macro $\!\pcol@bg@paintregion!\arg{a}\arg{c}$ is used only in
% $\!\pcol@bg@paint@ii!\Arg{A_b}\Arg{A_g}\Arg{A_c}$ but as many times as
% $\Abs{A_b}+\Abs{A_g}(\CBto-\CBfrom-1)+\Abs{A_c}(\CBto-\CBfrom)$ to paint
% \bground{} region $\bgr_a^{[c]}$ specified by $|\pcol@bg@@|{\cdot}a$

% 
% or, if it is undefined, $\bgc_a=|\pcol@bg@color@|{\cdot}a$.
% 
% \SpecialArrayIndex{a}{\pcol@bg@color@}
%
% If $\bgr_a^c$ or $\bgr_a$ is defined, the painted \bground{} is built in
% \!\@tempboxa! with \!\vtop! having null vertical skip at its top and by
% $\!\pcol@bg@paintregion@i!\Arg{F_x}\Arg{F_y}\Arg{F_w}\Arg{F_h}$ where
% the arguments are defined in the body of the macro $|\pcol@bg@@|{\cdot}a$
% 
% \SpecialArrayIndex{a}{\pcol@bg@@}
% 
% and thus we need triple \!\expandafter! to give them to the macro.  Prior
% to the invocatoin of the macro, we let $\!\reserved@a!=a'$ have
% $a{\cdot}|@|{\cdot}c$ if $\bgc_a^c$ is defined for $a\in\{G,C,g,c\}$, or
% $a$ otherwise definitely for $a\notin\{G,C,g,c\}$.
% 
% Then \!\pcol@bg@paintregion@i! calculates $x_0=\!\@tempdima!$,
% $y_0=\!\@tempdimb!$, $x_1=\!\@tempdimc!$ and $y_1=\!\dimen@!$ of the
% region $\bgr_a^{[c]}$ by $\!\pcol@bg@calculate!\arg{z}\arg{z_0}\Arg{F}$
% giving it
% $(z,z_0,F)\in\{(x_0,0,F_x),(y_0,0,F_y),(x_1,x_0,F_w),(y_1,y_0,F_h)\}$. Next
% we modify $\{x,y\}_{\{0,1\}}$ for \bgext{} by
% $\!\pcol@bg@addext!\arg{z}\Arg{s}\Arg{d}$ with $(z,s,d)\in
% \{(x_0,\hbox{`|-|'},|l|),(y_0,\hbox{`|-|'},|t|),
% (x_1,\emptyset,|r|),\~(y_1,\emptyset,|b|)\}$.
% 
% Now we have $[(x_0,y_0)(x_1,y_1)]$ and thus, if not \mirror{}ed, we place
% $\bgr_a^{[c]}$ at $(x_0,y_0)$ by a vertical skip of $y_0$ and shifting a
% \!\hbox! for the region right by $x_0$ by \!\moveright!, and paint the box
% putting a \!\vrule! of $(x_1-x_0)$ wide and $(y_1-y_0)$ tall, letting
% \!\current@color! have $\bgc_r^{[c]}=|\pcol@bg@colr|{\cdot}a'$ and then
% invoking \!\pcol@set@color! being the orinigal definition of
% \!\set@color!.
% 
% \SpecialArrayIndex{a{\cdot}\string\texttt{@}{\cdot}c}{\pcol@bg@color@}
% \SpecialArrayIndex{a}{\pcol@bg@color@}
% 
% On the other hand if \mirror{}ing is to be done, the region should be
% $[(\WT{-}x_1,y_0)(\WT{-}x_0,y)]$ and thus the shift amount for
% \!\moveright! of the \!\hbox! is $(x_1-\WT)$.
% 
% Then after \!\pcol@bg@paintregion@i! finshes its work,
% \!\pcol@bg@paintregion! lets the switch
% \CSIndex{ifpcol@bg@painted}${}=\true$ because we painted $\bgr_a^{[c]}$,
% lets the height, depth and width of \!\@tempboxa!  be 0 to make it a
% phantom, and then put it into the outside box opened by
% \!\pcol@bg@paint@i!.  On the other hand, if neither $\bgc_r^c$ nor

% The macro $\!\pcol@bg@calculate!\arg{z}\arg{z_0}\arg{F}$ is used in
% \!\pcol@bg@paintregion@i! and \!\pcol@bg@addext! to accumulate dimensional
% values specified in $F$ into a \!\dimen! register $z$ with initial value
% $z_0$.  The specificatoin $F$ is a sequence of $\!\@elt!\Arg{f}$ to add $f$
% to $z$, $\!\pcol@bg@negative!\Arg{F^-}$ to subtract the amount specified
% by $F^-$ from $z$, or macros expanded to either of them.
% 
% The macro makes \!\pcol@bg@dimen! \!\let!-equal to $z$ and \!\@elt! to
% \!\pcol@bg@advance!, lets $z=z_0$, and then does what is specified in $F$\@.
% Therefore, $\!\@elt!\arg{f}$ appearing directly or indirectly in $F$ does
% $\!\advance!\arg{z}\arg{f}$ for the accumulation.  On the other hand,
% \!\pcol@bg@negative! makes \!\@elt! \!\let!-equal to \!\pcol@bg@nadvance!
% to let $\!\@elt!\arg{f}$ do $\!\advance!\arg{z}{-}\arg{f}$ for
% subtraction, does $F^-$, and then remake $\!\@elt!=\!\pcol@bg@advance!$.
% Note that $f$ may be expanded to a negative amount having `|-|' its
% beginning to results in $\!\@elt!\arg{f}$ expanded to
% $\!\advance!\arg{z}{-}{-}\arg{f'}$ with some positive amount $f'$, but
% this double negation is legitimate in \TeX{} and is equivalent to
% $\!\advance!\arg{z}\arg{f'}$.  The macro \!\pcol@bg@negative! is used in

% Besides the macros shown above, $|\pcol@bg@@|{\cdot}a$ uses the following

% \begin{itemize}

% \!\pcol@bg@preposttop! being \!\pcol@bg@preposttop@left! or

% \!\pcol@output@end!, the latter of which may define only the left one if
% the closing environment is not \parapag{}ed.  That is, both of left and
% right macros are usually equivalent, but the right one can be smaller than
% the left if we have two or more (\lpage{}s of) \env{paracol} environments
% in a page and the closing environment is not \parapag{}ed while some
% others are.  In such case, \!\@outputpage! or \!\pcol@output@start!,
% another macro referring to them, must paint the region below
% \!\pcol@bg@preposttop@right! in the right page as a part of \preenv{} or

% \!\pcol@bg@preposttop@left! and \!\pcol@bg@preposttop@right! for the left
% and right \parapag{}es respectively.  Both macros have common initial
% value 0.

% The macro \!\pcol@output@start! is invoked solely from

% \!\pcol@zparacol! and to build the {\em\Uidx\spage} from which parallel
% columns start possibly with the stuff preceding \beginparacol{}, or
% {\em\Uidx\preenv} in short.  First, we turn
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@output}=\true$ so that \!\output!  requests for page
% breaks are processed by our own macros such as \!\pcol@makecol! hereafter.
% Then we let $p=\pbase={\ptop}=0$ and $\PP=()$ because we have nothing for
% $q<\ptop=0$.  We also move \!\@deferlist! to \!\@dbldeferlist! and then
% let \!\@deferlist! be empty because all \cwise{} dererred floats become
% \pwise{}.  In this float importation, as discussed in
% item-(\ref{item:ovv-float-@output@start}) of
% Section~\ref{sec:imp-ovv-float}, we force all floats in the list have
% depth 0 to ensure no one has |1sp| to conform our own and old-fashioned
% \pwise{} float placement mechanism\footnote{
% 
% Though having \texttt{1sp} is almost imposiible.}.
% 
% We then and let $\df=\bot$ because we don't have any deferred footnotes.
% 
% Next we caculate $H=H_r-(H_m+H_f+H_b)$ where $H_r=\!\@colroom!$, $H_m$ is
% the height-plus-depth of the main vertical list in \!\@holdpg!, $H_f$ is

% Otherwise, i.e., if $H\geq1.5\times\!\baselineskip!$, we invoke

% \Mgfnote{}s is excluded if any; and the skip of \!\textfloatsep! is added
% below the bottom floats also if any,
%

% \!\pcol@bg@paintbox! temporarily letting $\!\pcol@bg@textheight!=h$ so
% that $y_0=\HB$ and $y_1=h$ for $\bgr_{\{p,P\}}$.  This \bgpaint{} is not

% and let have the \spanning, but also for \!\pcol@rightpage! if $\CL<\C$ to
% mean \parapag{}ing for which we temporarily increment \!\c@page! by one if
% \npaired.
% 
% We also let $\pp^h(0)$ be the shrunk \!\@colht!, and $\pp^t(0)$ be
% \!\topskip! if $h=0$ assuming that the page does
% not have any \spanning{}\footnote{

% to typeset \colpage{}s from the top of the page, or otherwise be 0
% together with \!\topskip! to inhibit the ordinary \!\topskip! insertion.
% 
% As for $\pp^m(0)$, we define it as follows, referring to
% $\mpbout=\!\pcol@mparbottom@out!$ possibly having the positions of the
% last marginal notes in the last \env{paracol} environment in the page we
% are working on, and to $B=\!\@mparbottom!$ having the bottom edge of the
% last marginal note in \preenv{} including the last \env{paracol}
% environment if any.  First we \!\def!fine $\!\pcol@do@mpbout@whole!
% \<\mpb_L^l\>\<\mpb_L^r\>\<\mpb_R^l\>\<\mpb_R^r\>$ so that it redefines
% $\mpbout$ to let it have the arguments in the body, and \!\def!ine
% $\!\pcol@do@mpbout@elem!\@elt\Arg{t}\Arg{b}$ to let it have
% $\!\@elt!\Arg{0}\Arg{B}$ to be replaced with $\mpb_L^l$ or $\mpb_L^r$ in
% $\mpbout$.  Second, we invoke \!\pcol@do@mpbout! to update $\mpbout$ with
% the replacement using two macros above.  Third and finally, we invoke
% \!\pcol@bias@mpbout! giving it $-h$ to replace each $\mpar(t,b)$ in each
% element $\mpb_{\{L,R\}}^{\{l,r\}}$ in $\mpbout$, which we let $\pp^m(0)$

% coordinates for text area to that for columns and make it possible the
% first marginal note in each margin to exploit the space for \preenv{} if
% it is tall extraordinarily.
%

% \cwise{} float placement.
% 
% First, if we have let $\!\topskip!=0$ with the \preenv,

% but it is recognized as non-first by \TeX's page builder and thus it
% inserts \!\baselineskip! referring to \!\prevdepth! as the depth of the
% last item.  The important issue is that the \!\prevdepth! to be referred
% is assured having its value at \beginparacol, which is usually the depth
% of the last item of \spanning, by the following mechanism: (1)
% \!\pcol@invokeoutput! invoked in \!\pcol@zparacol! saves \!\prevdepth! in
% \!\pcol@prevdepth! before the \!\output! request for
% \!\pcol@output@start!; (2) \!\pcol@prevdepth! is saved in $\cc_c(\pd)$ by
% \!\pcol@setcurrcolnf!  invoked from \!\pcol@output@start! as discussed
% afterward; (3) when the column $c$ is visited for the first time, the
% special output routine \!\pcol@output@start! itself ($c=0$) or
% \!\pcol@output@switch! ($c>0$) restores \!\pcol@prevdepth! from
% $\cc_c(\pd)$ by \!\pcol@getcurrcol!; (4) \!\pcol@invokeoutput!  which made
% the \!\output! request for (3) lets \!\prevdepth! have the value of
% \!\pcol@prevdepth! after the request.  Therefore, the baseline progress
% from the last line of the \spanning{} to the first line of each
% \colpage{} should be very natural as we see in the third and fourth lines

% 
% The macro \!\pcol@makenormalcol! is invoked solely from
% \!\pcol@output@start! to let \!\@output~box! have the \preenv{} as
% \spanning{} of the \spage.  The operations this macro performs are very
% similar to those of \!\@makecol!, which in fact is used in this macro
% itself, but has the following differences.
% 
% \begin{enumerate}\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
% \item
% If $\CSIndex{ifpcol@mgfnote}=\true$, we exclude footnotes in \!\footins!
% from \!\@outputbox!, because they are \mgfnote{} with \Scfnote{}s given in
% columns, by saving it into \!\@tempboxa! during the building process and
% restoring it from the box register.
% 
% \item
% If \preenv{} does not have bottom floats, we build \!\@outputbox! by
% ourselves without relying on \!\@makecol! because the skips put into the
% bottom (or near it) by the macro is harmful to making \preenv{} and
% parallel columns naturally connected.  Therfore, we move
% \!\@holdpg! to \!\@outputbox! adding \!\footins! to its tail if any by
% \!\pcol@combinefootins!, and then combine top floats if any by
% \!\pcol@combinefloats!\footnote{
% 
% Since we do not have bottom floats, the order of materials in the
% resulting \!\@outputbox! being top floats, main text and footnotes should
% be consistent with other pages with any \LaTeX{} including p\LaTeX.}.
% 
% In addition, we clear \!\@midlist! and retuns its contents to
% \!\@freelist! as \!\@makecol! does.
% 
% \item
% If \preenv{} has bottom floats, on the other hand, we use \!\@makecol! to
% build \preenv{} in \!\@outputbox! moving \!\@holdpg! into \!\box!|255|
% prior to the invocation\footnote{
% 
% Therefore the order of footnotes and bottom floats is consistent with
% other pages and columns, i.e., footnote-first in the native \LaTeX{} while
% float-first in p\LaTeX{}, for example.}.
% 
% Also before invocation in addition, we temporarily let
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@lastpage}=\true$ to let
% $\!\@combinefloats!=\!\pcol@combinefloats!$ used in \!\@makecol!  put a
% vertical skip of \!\textfloatsep! below the bottom floats so that the
% floats are well seperated from the top of multi-column stuff in the
% \spage.  We also nullify \!\@textbottom! by making it \!\let!-equal to
% \!\relax! because it is unncessary to put an infinitely stretchable skip
% at the bottom\footnote{
% 
% Even if unharmful.},
% 
% and let $\!\vbadness!=10000$ to avoid an inevitable underfull message
% because \!\@makecol! lets \!\@outputbox! as tall as \!\textheight!.
% 
% \item
% In both cases but especially that with bottom floats, resulting
% \!\@outputbox! is decapsulated by \!\unvbox! to make its height {\em
% natural}.
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% Note that the special function for \sync{}ed \colpage{} in
% \!\pcol@combinefloats! used directly or indirectly in this macro, on the
% other hand, is not active in the invocation because \!\pcol@zparacol!
% initialized $\!\pcol@textfloatsep!=\infty$ to mean we have no \sync{}ation
% points.  Also
% note that bottom floats and non-\mgfnote{} footnotes are put in
% \!\@outputbox! and thus they will not appear at the bottom of the page
% but above the \colpage{}s in the page\footnote{
% 
% We could put them at the bottom by keeping them somewhere and insert them
% in \!\pcol@outputcolumns!, but it will cause another problem that the
% numbers of the figures and footnotes are smaller than those in \colpage{}s

% 
% The macro \!\pcol@output@switch! is invoked from
% \!\pcol@specialoutput! to process the special \!\output! request made in
% \!\pcol@switchcol!, \!\pcol@visitallcols! and \!\pcol@flushclear!, for a
% \cswitch{} from $c=\!\pcol@currcol!$ to $d=\!\pcol@nextcol!$ which can be
% $c$.  The macro is also invoked from \!\pcol@makeflushedpage!  to \sync{}e
% and to flush all \ccolpage{}s but staying in $c$.
% 
% First, we examine if the \cswitch{} is to close a \mctext, i.e.,
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@sptext}={\true}$ and $c=0$, and if so we do the
% followings; add the height of \!\pcol@prespan! having \prespan{} to
% \!\@colroom! which we temporarily shrank when the \mctext{} starts unless
% the box is void to mean we have had a page break in the \mctext; add an
% elemnent $\spt(H,h)$ to the tail of $\pp^s(\ptop)=\!\pcol@sptextlist!$ by
% \!\pcol@getcurrpage! and \!\pcol@defcurrpage!, where $H$ is the height of
% \!\pcol@prespan! plus the total height of top floats measured by
% \!\pcol@addflhd!, and $h$ is the height-plus-depth of \!\@holdpg! having
% (a part of) \mctext, represented in the form of integers and thus expanded
% with \!\number!; shift \!\@holdpg! left by \!\pcol@shiftspanning! if
% the column-0 is not the leftmost due to \cswap; and then put \prespan{}
% and (maybe shifted) \!\@holdpg! into \!\@holdpg! itself so as to let
% \!\@holdpg! have everything in the \colpage{} 0 as usual.  Note that we
% perform these operations at the first \cswitch{} for \cscan{}ing from
% $c=0$ with $\CSIndex{ifpcol@sptext}=\true$, i.e., not for \sync{}ation
% taking place afterword as explained shortly.
% 
% Then regardless of the operations above, we acquire an \!\insert! from
% \!\@freelist! by \!\@next! for $\cc_c(\vb)$ to store the \ccolpage{} in
% (maybe modified) \!\@holdpg! by \!\pcol@clearcst@unvbox! to add uncoloring
% \!\special!s to rewind the \colorstack{} $\CST^c$ at the bottom and
% possibly coloring ones to establish that saved in $\csts$ at the top as
% the \colorctext{} for the \colpage{} when it has the first item.
% 
% Then if $\!\footins!\neq\bot$, we perform one of the followings.
% 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
% If \Scfnote{} typesetting is in effect and $p=\ptop$, we save \!\footins!
% into $\pp^f(p)$ by the sequence of \!\pcol@getcurrpinfo! to get $\pp(p)$,
% \!\pcol@savefootins! to move it in $\pp^f(p)$, and \!\pcol@defcurrpage! to
% update $\pp(p)$ with $\pp^f(p)$.
% 
% \item
% If \Scfnote{} typesetting is in effect but $p<\ptop$, we simply discard
% the contents of \!\footins!  by making it $\bot$, because \!\footins!
% should have $\pp^f(p)$ which has been already fixed.
%

% Next, we examine if $\CSIndex{ifpcol@sptext}=\true$ and $c=0$ again, and

% $\!\everypar!=\cc_c(\ep)$, to pretend all columns follow the \mctext.
% That is, for each column $e$, we restore its \cctext{} from $\cc_e$ by
% \!\pcol@getcurrcol!, let \CSIndex{if@nobreak} and \CSIndex{if@afterindent}

% state.
% 
% Note that this broadcast is essential when the \mctext{} has sectioning
% commands to have consistent settings of the page break inhibition, the
% skip above the another sectioning command following them, and the
% indentation of the first paragraph, for all columns.  On the other hand,
% broadcasting of \!\everypar! is natural even when it does not have
% sectioning commands because all columns may be considered following the
% \mctext.  Also note that, as mentioned in the explanation of the first
% examination at the beginning of this macro, we perform these operations at
% the first \cswitch{} for \cscan{}ning from $c=0$ with
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@sptext}=\true$, i.e., not for \sync{}ation taking place

% 
% The macro \!\pcol@putbackmvl!, solely used in

% column $c$ to be restarted in $\cc_c(\vb)=\!\@currbox!$.  If so, the
% \colorstack{} $\CST^c$ is saved into $\csts=\!\pcol@colorstack@saved!$ by
% \!\pcol@savecolorstack! as the opening \colorctext{} of the \colpage{},
% and \!\pcol@prespan! for \prespan{} is made $\bot$.
% 
% Otherwise, $\csts$ is nullified because the opening \colorctext{} has
% already been put when we left from the \colpage{}.  Then if
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@sptextstart}=\true$ to mean a \mctext{} is to start, we
% save $\cc_c(\vb)$ into \!\pcol@prespan! adding the colorling \!\special!s
% to restore \colorctext{} from $\CST^c$ by \!\pcol@restorecolorstack!.  We
% also shrink $\cc_c(\vb^r)=\!\@colroom!$ by the height of the \prespan{} so
% that \mctext{} will be captured by \!\pcol@makecol! if it is broken into
% two (or more) pages, and put a invisible \!\hrule! to the main vertical
% list letting $\!\topskip!=0$ to supress \!\topskip! insertion prior to the
% \mctext{} but instead to make the text led by \!\baselineskip! (or
% \!\lineskip!) according to the \!\prevdepth!  being the depth of the
% tallest column and the height of the first \!\hbox! in the \mctext.
% Otherwise, i.e., if $\CSIndex{ifpcol@sptextstart}=\false$, we simply put
% back $\cc_c(\vb)$ into the main vertical list and then the coloring
% \!\special!s by \!\pcol@restorecolorstack!.

% did not make \sync{}ed \cswitch{}, i.e., if $\CSIndex{ifpcol@flush}=\true$

% 
% The macro $\!\pcol@deferredfootins!\arg{macro}$, invoked from
% \!\pcol@startcolumn! and \!\pcol@restartcolumn!, tries to \!\insert! some
% of leading deferred footnotes in $\df$ through \!\footins!\footnote{
% 
% The argument $\arg{macro}$ has the invoker itself shown in debug
% messages.}.
% 
% In order to avoid that \!\footins! has footnotes across three or more
% pages to make confusion in the order of footnotes kept inside of \TeX, we
% cap the total height of footnotes by $h=\!\@colht!$ if it has already
% shrunk by non-deferred footnotes in the page we are working on indicated
% by $\!\@tempdimb!<0$, or $h=\!\@colht!-\!\skip!\!\footins!$ if the page
% does not have non-deferred footnotes indicated by $\!\@tempdimb!=0$.  That
% is, we extract leading elements of $\df$ by \!\vsplit! until their total
% height reaches $h$ and, if some elements are obtained in \!\@tempboxa!,
% \!\insert!  them through \!\footins!.  As for the remaining elements if
% any, we add a leading \!\penalty!\!\interlinepenalty! which should have
% been removed by \!\vsplit!.
% 
% Note that we temporarily let $\!\splitmaxdepth!=\!\@maxdepth!$,
% $\!\splittopskip!=0$ and $\!\vbadness!=\infty$ at the \!\vsplit! so that
% the depth of the split first half is \!\@maxdepth! at deepest, the second
% half does not have any skip at its top, and \TeX{} will not complain of
% (almost) inevitable underfull.  Also note that the successful extraction
% of the leading elements is examined by checking \!\ht!\!\@tempboxa! and
% thus we need to \!\unvbox!  it in itself because \!\vsplit! makes the

% 
% constructs the \preenv{} in \!\@outputbox!, combining the stuff in the box
% $b$ and pre-environment footnotes in the \!\insert! $f$.  It is almost
% equivalent to the \cs{else} part of \!\@makecol! in which the main
% vertical list and \Mcfnote{}s are combined.  The operation to put
% footnotes is almost equivalent to the second half of the \cs{else} part
% except that \!\insert!  is not always \!\footins! but $f$ and is done by
% \!\pcol@putfootins! in which a null vertical skip is added after $f$ but
% this skip is removed by \!\unskip! after the invocation.
% 
% The null vertical skip is put for \Scfnote{}s, for which the macro
% \!\pcol@putfootins! is invoked from \!\pcol@ioutputelt! and
% \!\pcol@makeflushedpage!.  Since we shrink the height of \colpage{}s by
% the height-plus-depth of \Scfnote{}s, the natural height of the box in
% which \colpage{}s and \Scfnote{}s are combined would be less than
% \!\textheight! due to the depth of the last footnote line if we simply
% made the footnotes the last items of the box.  Though this shortage at
% most \!\maxdepth! is expected to be covered by the stretch factor of
% \!\skip!\!\footins! without too large badness causing an underfull
% message\footnote{
% 
% With default settings of $\cs{maxdimen}=5\,|pt|$ and the stretch factor
% 4\,|pt| of \cs{skip}\cs{footins}, the badness $100\times(5/4)^3\approx195$
% is significantly less than the default $\cs{vbadness}=1000$.},
% 
% someday we could face an underfull with some unusual settings of
% \!\maxdimen!, \!\skip!\!\footins! and/or \!\vbadness!.  Therefore, we put a
% null vertical skip so that the real bottom of the footnotes, instead of
% the last baseline, is placed at the baseline of the box, to make the
% natural height of the box is \!\textheight! exactly.  Note that this
% shifting \Scfnote{}s up will not make last baselines of footnotes among
% pages unaligned, because the last line have a strut.

% \begin{macro}{\pcol@@addmarginpar}
% \changes{v1.3-4}{2013/09/17}
%	{Introduced to keep the original definition of \cs{@addmarginpar}.}
% \def\swap{\mathit{swap}}
% 
% The macro \!\pcol@addmarginpar! is our own version of \!\@addmarginpar!,
% which \!\pcol@zparacol! makes \!\let!-equal to \!\pcol@addmarginpar!
% keeping its original definition in \!\pcol@@addmarginpar!.  Therefore, in
% an \env{paracol} environment, the \!\output! request made by \LaTeX's
% \!\marginpar! in the column $c$ and page $p$ is processed by
% \!\pcol@addmarginpar! through our own \!\output! routine being
% \!\pcol@output!, \!\pcol@specialoutput! and \LaTeX's \!\@specialoutput!.
% What we do in this macro are as follows;  determine the margin which a
% marginal note goes to; temporarily modify the parameter
% $m_w=\!\marginparwidth!$ or $m_s=\!\marginparsep!$ according to the margin
% and the column; determine the position to place the marginal note
% consulting $\pp^m(p)=\!\pcol@mparbottom!$ obtained by
% \!\pcol@getcurrpage!: and update $\pp^m(p)$ according to the postion.
% 
% First, there are the following parameters to determine the margin, and thus
% the value of $\CSIndex{if@firstcolumn}$ referred to in \LaTeX's
% \!\@addmarginpar! and meaning left if $\true$ or right if $\false$.
% 
% \begin{enumerate}\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
% \item
% The macros \!\pcol@mpthreshold@l! and \!\pcol@mpthreshold@r! defined by
% \!\marginpar~threshold!\ give us the threshold of the column number to let
% columns less than it go to the left margin while those equal to or greater
% than it to the right, according to the \parapag{}e the column belongs to.
% Therefore, we let $\CSIndex{if@firstcolumn}=\true$ iff
% $c<\!\pcol@mpthreshold@l!\land c<\CL$ or $c<\!\pcol@mpthreshold@r!\land
% c\geq\CL$, as the fundamental setting.
% 
% \item
% If $\CSIndex{ifpcol@swapmarginpar}=\true$ because the specifier `|m|' is
% given to \!\twosided! explicitly or implicitly, the decision in (1) is
% reversed if $\page(p)\bmod2=0$, and then this decision is reversed again
% if $c\geq\CL$ and $\CSIndex{ifpcol@paired}=\false$ to mean $c$ is in a
% \npaired{} right \parapag{}e.  The second reversal is done because
% $\page(p)$ is \emph{common} to both left and right \parapag{}es and is for
% the left page in usual cases without page number jumps.  Therefore,
% $(\page(p)\bmod2)$ is for left \parapag{}es and thus for right counterparts
% the decision should be made by $((\page(p)+1)\bmod2)$ and thus the result
% should be reversed.
% 
% \item
% If \CSIndex{if@reversemargin} is made $\true$ by \LaTeX's
% \!\reversemarginpar!, the decision made by (1) and then possibly reversed
% by (2) is finally reversed.
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% Second, we calculate
% $$
% D=\!\@tempdima!=\sum_{d=\Cfrom}^{\swap(c)-1}(w_{\swap(d)}+g_{\swap'(d)})
% $$
% where $x'=swap(x)$ is given by
% $\!\pcol@swapcolumn!\<x\>\<x'\>\<\Cfrom\>\<\Cto\>$ to let
% $x'=\Cto-(x-\Cfrom)-1$ if $\CSIndex{ifpcol@swapcolumn}=\true$ and
% $\page(p)\bmod2=0$ or $x'=x$ otherwise,
% $\swap'(x)=\!\pcol@colsepid!\in\{\swap(x)-1,x\}$ according to swapped or
% not, $(\Cfrom,\Cto)\in\{(0,\CL),(\CL,\C)\}$ according to $c<\CL$ or not,
% and $\w_x$ and $\gap_x$ are the width of $x$-th column and gap given by
% $|\pcol@columnwidth|{\cdot}x$ and $|\pcol@columnsep|{\cdot}x$
% respectively.
% 
% \SpecialArrayIndex{c}{\pcol@columnwidth}
% \SpecialArrayIndex{c}{\pcol@columnsep}
% 
% That is, $D$ is the distance from the left edge of the column $c$ to that
% of leftmost column in the (paralell-)
% 
% \Index{parallel-paging}
% 
% page in which $c$ resides.  Then if $\CSIndex{if@firstcolumn}=\true$ to
% let the margial note go to the left margin, we add $D$ to
% $m_w=\!\marginparwidth!$ so that \LaTeX's \!\@addmarginpar! being
% \!\pcol@@addmarginpar! aligns the left edge of the marginal note at the
% point apart from the column's left edge by $(D+m_w)+m_s$ rather than
% $m_w+m_s$, or in other words $m_w+m_s$ apart from the left edge of the
% leftmost column.  On the other hand if $\CSIndex{if@firstcolumn}=\false$,
% we add $\WT-(D+w_c)$ where $\WT$ is \!\textwidth!, being the distance from
% the right edge of the column $c$ to that of the rightmost column, to
% $m_s=\!\marginparsep!$ so that \!\pcol@@addmarginpar!  aligns the left
% edge of the marginal note at the point apart from the column's right edge
% by $\WT-(D+w_c)+m_s$ rather than $m_s$, or in other words $m_s$ apart from
% the right edge of the rightmost column.
% 
% Third, we let $t=\!\@tempdima!$ be the distance from the top edge of the
% column to that of the marginal note, namely \!\@pageht! minus the height
% of \Midx{\!\pcol@marbox!} being a box having the note and thus
% \!\@currbox! or \!\@marbox! according to $\CSIndex{if@firstcolumn}=\true$
% or not.  We also let $h=\!\@tempdimb!$ be the height-plus-depth of the box
% \!\pcol@marbox!  plus \!\marginparpush!, or in other words the vertical
% space the marginal note requires.  Then we give $t$ and $h$ to
% \!\pcol@getmparbottom! to let \!\@mparbottom! have the bottom of the
% exisiting marginal text below which we put the margial text in
% \!\pcol@marbox!, and to let \!\pcol@mpblist! have the new list to
% be replaced with $\mpb_{\{L,R\}}^{\{l,r\}}$ in $\pp^m(p)$.
% 
% Forth, we update $\pp^m(p)$ with the new list in \!\pcol@mpblist! by a
% process similar to \!\pcol@setpageno! but with \!\pcol@setmpbelt! to scan
% the list of pages $\PPP$.
% 
% Finally, we invoke \LaTeX's original \!\@addmarginpar! being
% \!\pcol@@addmarginpar! to put the marginal note according to
% \CSIndex{if@firstcolumn}, temporarily modified \!\marginparsep! and
% \!\marginparwidth!, and \!\@mparbottom!.  Note that since
% \!\pcol@zparacol! lets $\CSIndex{if@twocolumn}\~=\true$,
% \!\pcol@@addmarginpar! determine the margin only by
% \CSIndex{if@firstcolumn}.  Also note that it can be $\!\@mparbottom!>t$ to
% mean the marginal note should be placed below the baseline at which
% \!\marginpar! appears, i.e., at \!\@pageht! below from the column top, and
% if so \!\pcol@@addmarginpar! will give us a warning as the correct
% consequence of the placement.

% The macro $\!\pcol@setmpbelt!
% \Arg{\pp^p(q)}\<\pp^i(q)\>\<\pp^f(q)\>\Arg{\pp^s(q)}\Arg{\pp^m(q)}$ is
% used solely in \!\pcol@addmarginpar! and is applied to $\PPP$ to update an
% element $M\in\Set{\mpb_X^x}{X\in\{L,R\},x\in{l,r}}$ in $\pp^m(p)$ with
% $M'=\!\pcol@mpblist!$ given by \!\pcol@getmparbottom!.  The structure of
% the macro is similar to \!\pcol@setpnoelt! to upadate $\pp^p(q)$ s.t.\
% $q\geq p$, but in this macro the target of the update is only $p$.  Then
% for $q=p$, we invoke \!\pcol@setmpbelt@i! giving it the body of $\pp^m(p)$
% being
% $\Arg{\mpb_L^l}\Arg{\mpb_L^r}\Arg{\mpb_R^l}\Arg{\mpb_R^r}$, or
% $\<\emptyset\>\<\emptyset\>\<\emptyset\>\<\emptyset\>$ if
% $\pp^m(p)=\emptyset$, to obtain what $\pp^m(p)$ should have in
% $\pp_{\mathit{new}}^m(p)=\!\reserved@a!$ in which $\mpb_X^x$ is replaced
% with $M'$, where $X=L$ or $X=R$ if $c<\CL$ or not respectively, and $x=l$
% or $x=r$ if $\CSIndex{if@firstcolumn}=\true$ or not respectively, and then

% 
% The macro $\Uidx\mpboutz=\!\pcol@mparbottom@zero!$ is used in
% \!\@outputpage!, \!\pcol@getmparbottom@last! and \!\pcol@output@end! to
% give the default value of $\Uidx\mpbout=\!\pcol@mparbottom@out!$ with
% $\mpar(0,0)$ for all elements $M\in\Set{\mpb_X^x}{X\in\{L,R\},x=\{l,r\}}$
% to mean a page has no marginal notes carrying over from the preceding
% \env{paracol} environments.
% 
% As for $\mpbout$, besides the top level initialization to make it
% $\mpboutz$, it is updated in \!\pcol@output@end! through macros
% \!\pcol@getmparbottom@last! and \!\pcol@bias@mpbout! to have the last
% element of each $M\in\Set{\mpb_X^x}{X\in\{L,R\},x=\{l,r\}}$ in
% $\pp^m(\ptop)$ with transformation from coordinates of columns to that of
% text area, or directly with $\mpboutz$ if the \lpage{} will not have
% \postenv.  The resulting $\mpbout$ is at first used in \!\pcol@output@end!
% itself through \!\pcol@do@mpbout! to let \!\@mparbottom! have the value
% $b$ of $\mpar(t,b)$ in $\mpb_L^l$ or $\mpb_L^r$ according to the side
% margin which marginal notes in \postenv{} goes to.
% 
% Then $\mpbout$ is passed to the next \env{paracol} environment if it
% resides in the page where the previous environment also resides, to be
% referred to by \!\pcol@output@start! which also performs
% \!\pcol@do@mpbout! and \!\pcol@bias@mpbout! to let $\pp^m(0)$ have the
% lists according to $\mpbout$ and $\!\@mparbottom!$ which can be modified
% in \postenv{} of the previous environment or in other word
% in \preenv{} of starting envionment.  By this setting of $\pp^m(0)$,
% marginal note placement in the \spage{} is aware of the marginal notes
% having been placed in previous environments and in \preenv{} and thus can
% correctly examines if a marginal note to be added in a margin collide 
% the last one in the margin.  On the other hand, if the \postenv{}
% encounters a page break before a new environment starts, our own
% \!\@outputpage! should be invoked at the page break to let
% $\mpbout=\mpboutz$ because the marginal notes in previous environments do
% not afffect those in the new environment.
% 
% Note that $\mpbout$ is also referred to and updated by
% \!\pcol@do@mpb@all@i! and \!\pcol@do@mpb@all@ii! because they are used in

% \sync{}ation point, and thus a smaller value results in a larger interline
% skip and the special value $-1000\,|pt|$ to inhibit the skip by, e.g.,
% \!\nointerlineskip!, is given the highest priority.
% 
% Note that $\VPP$ and $\DP$ are only for the \lpage{} and thus referred to
% by \!\pcol@output@end! to close the environment, and the former is done by
% \!\pcol@makeflushedpage! if it works on the page.  The reason why we add
% \!\textfloatsep! to $\VPP$ is to make the last page well separated from
% the \postenv{} if the tallest column, taking the addition into account,
% has bottom floats.  Also note that we let
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@dfloats}=\false$ before scanning columns with
% \!\pcol@measurecolumn! so that the switch becomes $\true$ after the scan
% iff a column has deferred floats (in the \lpage{}).

% As described above, any items can be empty, naturally for top floats,
% footnotes and bottom floats, but also including main vertical lists if the
% \ccolpage{}s were not in $\ptop$ before the invocation of
% \!\pcol@flushcolumn!.  Moreover, all main vertical lists can be empty if
% all \lcolpage{}s just have started (by \!\newpage!, for example).  More
% weirdly, the case of all-empty main vertical lists can be accompanied with
% other non-empty items when columns have floats or footnotes which cannot
% be in $\ptop-1$ but are found their places in $\ptop$.
%
% Taking it into account that any items can be empty and the other item
% of \Scfnote{}s, we have to determine whether the following two operations
% are taken;  invocation of \!\pcol@synccolumn! for each \colpage{} to set a
% \sync{}ation point or to add an infinite stretch (and shrink) to its
% bottom;  and the examination of the height of each \colpage{}, taking the
% \sync{}ation point to be set into account, to tell the necessity of
% explicit page break with $\CSIndex{ifpcol@flush}=\true$.  For the latter
% we calculate the examination target $V=\!\@tempdimb!$ to be compared with
% $\pp^h(\ptop)$, while for the former we determine the value of a switch
% $f=\CSIndex{if@tempswa}$ so that we invoke \!\pcol@synccolumn! iff
% $f=\true$ and $V\geq0$.
% 
% For \sync{}ed \cswitch{} with $\CSIndex{ifpcol@clear}=\false$, we let
% $f=(\VT\geq0)$ to mean at least one \colpage{} has a top float or
% non-empty main vertical list, i.e., $\Fc(\{t,m\})={\true}$ for some
% $c\In0\C$.  That is if $\VT<0$, since the next items added to all
% \colpage{}s are placed at the top of the page\footnote{
% 
% In usual cases, but it can mean some of them have negative vertical
% sizes.  Even though we can detect such a very unlikely special case, it is
% very tough to define the reasonable \sync{}ation point above the top of
% $\ptop$.  Therefore, we assume the point is at the top of $\ptop$ and thus
% do nothing.},
% 
% we don't need to set \sync{}ation points in them.  As for $V$, we let
% $V=\max(\VT,0)+\max(\VB,0)+v^f$ where $v^f$ is the sum of
% height-plus-depth of $\pp^f(\ptop)$ and $\!\skip!{\cdot}\pp^f(\ptop)$ if
% $\ptop$ has \Scfnote{}s, or 0 otherwise\footnote{
% 
% In the real implementation, $V=-\infty$ if $\VT=\VB=-\infty$ and no
% \Scfnote{}s are presented, but this difference does not affect the
% decisoins because $f\land(V\geq0)=(\VT<0)\land(V\geq0)=\false$ and
% $V\leq\pp^f(\ptop)$ with either $V=0$ or $V=-\infty$.}.
% 
% Note that it can be $\VP+v^f\leq\pp^h(\ptop)<\VT+\VB+v^f=V$ to mean
% setting the \sync{}ation point at $\VT$ below $\ptop$'s top edge would
% push bottom stuff beyond its bottom edge and thus we need an explicit page
% break to place the point at the top of $\ptop+1$ (in usual cases).
% 
% For \pfcheck{} or page flushing with $\CSIndex{ifpcol@clear}=\true$ on
% the other hand, we let $f=\lnot\!\pcol@sync!$ to invoke \!\pcol@synccolumn!
% only for page flushing and thus not for \pfcheck{}.  As for $V$, we let
% $V'=\VPP$ or $V'=\VP$ according as we working on \lpage{} or not, and
% then let $V=\max(V',0)+v^f$ or $V=V'$ according as $\ptop$ has \Scfnote{}s
% or not.  That is, we have to invoke \!\pcol@synccolumn! unless $\ptop$ is
% perfectly empty.
% 
% Then if $\CSIndex{ifpcol@clear}=\false$ and
% $\max(V,\;V-D'_T+\VE)>\pp^h(\ptop)$ where $D'_T=\DT$ if $0\leq\DT<\infty$ or
% 0 otherwise, or $\CSIndex{ifpcol@clear}=\true$ and
% $V>\pp^h(\ptop)$\footnote{
% 
% The examination is redundant in page flushing with
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@sync}=\false$ because it is assured that no overflow
% happens in any \colpage{} by \pfcheck{} and explicit page breaking, but is
% not harmful.},
% 
% we flush the page.  That is, if the condition above holds,
% we let $\CSIndex{ifpcol@flush}=\true$ and $d=\!\pcol@nextcol!={\cmax}$ to
% tell \!\pcol@switchcol! or \!\pcol@flushclear! to make an explicit page
% break in the column $\cmax$ from which we restart, and $f=\false$ to skip
% \!\pcol@synccolumn! to postpone the \exsync{}.  Note that the bias
% $\VE=\!\pcol@@ensurevspace!$ in \sync{}ed \cswitch{} is to avoid breaking a
% \colpage{} just below the \sync{}ation point due to too small space below
% the point, less than \!\baselineskip! in default but can be other
% threshold explicitly defined by \!\ensurevspace!.  That is,
% since $V-\DT+k\!\baselineskip!$ usually means the vertical position at
% which $k$-th baseline below the \sync{}ation point is placed, the flushing
% condition with $\VE=k\!\baselineskip!$ ensures that the page is flushed
% iff the space below the point cannot accommodate $k$ lines.  Also note that
% necessary flushing with $V>\pp^h(p)$ assuredly takes place even when
% $\DT$ is unusually large and/or $\VE$ is negative to make $-\DT+\VE<0$.
% 
% Finally if $V\geq0$ and $f=\true$, we invoke \!\pcol@synccolumn! for each
% column $c\In0\C$ to set a \sync{}ation point in it or to add an infinite
% stretch (and shrink) at its bottom for flushing.

% 
% The macro \!\pcol@flushcolumn! is invoked for each column $c\In0\C$ from
% \!\pcol@sync! to ship out the \ccolpage{} of $c$ into $\S_c$ if it is not
% leading one\Index{leading column-page}, i.e., $p=\cc_c(\vb^p)<\ptop$.  The
% macro also ships out \fpage{}s from $p+1$ up to $\ptop-1$ if we have
% deferred floats to fill them and, if this float flushing still leaves
% deferred floats, puts some of them to the \lcolpage{} being
% current\Index{current column-page}{} now as its top and/or bottom floats.
% 
% First we obtain the \cctext{} in $\cc_c$ by \!\pcol@getcurrcol! and
% examines if $p=\cc_c(\vb^p)<\ptop$.  If it does not hold to mean $c$ has
% \lcolpage{}, we do nothing.
% 
% Otherwise, we save \CSIndex{ifpcol@lastpage} into
% \CSIndex{ifpcol@lastpagesave} turning the former switch $\false$ because we
% are working on a non-\lcolpage{} definitely in a non-\lpage.  Then we put
% the contents of the \ccolpage{} $\cc_c(\vb^b)$ adding \!\vfil! at its tail
% into \!\box!|255| being the \TeX's standard interface to carry the main
% vertical list for \!\output!  routine.  We also move everything in
% $\cc_c(\ft)$ obtained by \!\pcol@getcurrfoot! into \!\footins! and return
% $\cc_c(\ft)$ to \!\@freelist! if $\cc_c(\ft^b)$ is not void.
% 
% Then we obtain $p$'s \pctext{} by \!\pcol@getcurrpage! and, if it has
% \Scfnote{}s in $\pp^f(p)$, we shrink \!\@colht! by the space required for
% the footnotes using \!\pcol@shrinkcolbyfn! and add the stretch\slash
% shrink compontents of $\!\skip!\cdot\pp^f(p)$ at the bottom of
% \!\box!|255| by \!\pcol@unvbox@cclv!, as we did in \!\pcol@makecol!.
% Otherwise we take a special care of the case that the height-plus-depth of
% $\cc_c(\vb^b)$ is greater than $\pp^h(p)$ due to that its height is almost
% equal to $\pi^h(p)$ and thus its depth makes the hight-plus-depth
% exceeding $\pi^h(p)$.  This excess is revealed by the \!\vfil! we just
% have added making the height-plus-depth the height of \!\box!|255|, and
% would cause overfull in \!\@makecol! and \!\pcol@@makecol! because they
% need the height, i.e., not height-plus-depth, of \!\box!|255| not
% exceeding $\pp^h(p)$.  Therefore if it happens, we we remove the \!\vfil!
% and cap the height of \!\box!|255| by \!\@maxdepth!  to pretend as if the
% box is directly passed from \TeX's page builder.
% 
% Next we examine if $\cc_c(\tr)$ was made $\infty$ by \!\pcol@makefcolumn!
% invoked from this macro itself when it processed the \colpage{} in the
% previous \pfcheck{} for environment closing, which found a page break
% should be done.  That is, $\cc_c(\tr)=\infty$ means the \ccolpage{} was
% once judged to be in the \lpage{} but \pfcheck{} forced a page break to
% make it non-last, it should have all deferred floats now listed in
% $\cc_c(\tl)$ at \Endparacol{}, but their total size is less than the
% threshold to make a usual \fcolumn{} for the \lpage.  If so, since the page
% is not last now, we put all floats in $\cc_c(\tl)$ by \!\pcol@makefcolpage!
% as the ship-out image in \!\@outputbox!, ignoring the contents added to
% \!\box!|255| in the operations above because $\cc_c(\vb^b)$ should be
% empty, and letting $\cc_c(\tr)=0$ to mean the floats have been
% processed\footnote{
% 
% $\cc_c(\tl)$ can have any values other than $\infty$ because definitely it
% will not be referred to in its inherent sense in the situation with no
% further float additions and no deferred floats.}.
% 
% Otherwise, since the \colpage{} can be put as usual, we invoke
% \!\pcol@@makecol!\footnote{
% 
% Neither \cs{pcol@makecol} because \!\box!\texttt{255} has \!\vfil! at its
% tail and the \colpage{} should be short enough, nor \cs{@makecol} because
% we need to ensure the depth of resulting \cs{@outputbox} is capped.}
% 
% giving \!\@maxdepth! to it to build the complete \colpage{} in
% \!\@outputbox! with depth capping and with the following setting\footnote{
% 
% \LaTeX's has another \!\insert! named \!\@kludgeins! for \!\enlargepage!
% but \Paracol{} does not cares about it.}.
% $$
% \begin{array}{lll}

% \!\@midlist!=\cc_c(\ml)&
% \!\@toplist!=\cc_c(\tl)&
% \!\@botlist!=\cc_c(\bl)
% \end{array}
% $$

%	 \cs{pcol@makefcolpage}.}
% 
% The macro \!\pcol@makefcolumn! is invoked solely from \!\pcol@flushcolumn!
% to put deferred floats in the currently empty \colpage{} of $c$ in the
% \tpage{} $\ptop$ which is being flushed.  Since we have to take special care
% of the case of environment closing, we cannot do this operation by
% \!\@makefcolumn!, while in other cases for \!\flushpage! and \!\clearpage!
% we also have to pay a small attention.
% 
% First, we scan the copy of $\cc_c(\dl)$ applying \!\pcol@makefcolelt! to
% each element to have the floats to be put in \!\@toplist!, which is
% assuredly empty because the \ccolpage{} of $c$ has already been shipped
% out to empty it, and those still deferred in $\cc_c(\dl)$.  Prior to scan,
% we let $H_r=\pp^h(\ptop)\footnotemark+\alpha$\footnotetext{
% 
% $\pp^h(\ptop)$ referred in this macro may have been shrunk by \Scfnote{}s
% in \cs{pcol@flushcolumn}.},
% 
% as the space initially available for
% floats each of which being $\phi$ is assumed to consume
% $v(\phi)=h(\phi)+d(\phi)+\alpha$, and $H_t=\!\@colroom!=-\alpha$ as the
% initial value of the accumulated size of $v(\phi)$ for all $\phi$ to be
% put, where $\alpha=\!\floatsep!$ if $\CSIndex{ifpcol@lastpage}=\true$
% 
% \SpecialIndex{\ifpcol@lastpage}
% 
% as discussed afterward, or $\alpha=\!\@fpsep!$ otherwise.
% 
% Then if the resulting \!\@toplist! is not empty\footnote{
% 
% It can happen if the first float is larger than $\pp^h(\ptop)$.},
% 
% we examine if $\ptop$ is the \lpage{} ($|\ifpcol@|\~|lastpage|=\true$)
% and $\cc_c(\dl)$ is empty to mean the last \colpage{} have all deferred
% floats.  This case is subtle because if we make the \colpage{} a \fcolumn{}
% it can be sparse and unnecessarily throw the \postenv{} to the next
% page.  Therefore, we intend to pack floats to the page top as top floats
% and thus have let $\alpha=\!\floatsep!$ in the building process of
% \!\@toplist! above\footnote{
% 
% We dare to do it knowing the natural component of \!\floatsep! is a little
% bit (4pt) larger than that \!\@fpsep! and the possibility of having
% fewer floats than those given by \!\@makefcolumn!.},
% 
% but it may make a too tall \colpage{} only having floats shrinking
% the \postenv{} in the page.  In addition, if other columns have
% \fpage{}s in the \lpage, packing the floats as top floats should give
% inconsistent appearance but we don't know whether the columns following
% $c$ has \fpage{}s.  Therefore, we performs this float packing if making
% the \fpage{} gives too sparse, more specifically if
% $H_t<\!\floatpagefraction!\times\pp^h(\ptop)=\!\@fpmin!$, but postpone the
% final decision until the \colpage{} is eventually shipped out by
% \!\pcol@flushcolumn! or \!\pcol@makeflushedpage!.  That is, if the all
% conditions above hold, we keep \!\@toplist! so that it is saved in
% $\cc_c(\tl)$ and let $\cc_c(\tr)=\infty$ to indicate that the column has
% pending floats.  Note that the floats are shipped out by
% \!\pcol@flushcolumn! if the \pfcheck{} currently being performed finds a 
% too tall column in $\ptop$ to force a page break making $\ptop$ non-last.
% Also note that, in any cases, letting $\cc_c(\tr)=\infty$ is safe because
% no longer we will have any float additions to the \colpage.
% 
% Otherwise, i.e., if we are working on a non-\lpage{} to be flushed or a
% \fcolumn{} is to be made for the \lpage, we put all floats in \!\@toplist!
% in a \!\vbox! of $\pp^h(\ptop)$ tall by \!\pcol@makefcolpage! and then 
% let $\cc_c(\vb^b)$ be another \!\vbox! having it.  This encapsulation of
% the \fcolumn{} is necessary because $\cc_c(\vb^b)$ can be put back to the
% main vertical list after the \pfcheck{} to remove skips above and below
% the floats, namely \!\@fptop! and \!\@fpbot!, if the contents were not
% encapsulated.

% The second and third cases are for \sync{}ed \cswitch{}.  The second case
% is for $\DT=\infty$ to mean the \sync{}ation point is set just below the
% top floats of a column whose main vertical list is empty because it is
% definitely $\VT\geq0>-\infty$.  In this case, we should not put anything
% back to the main vertical list, because the column having defined the
% point will restart from the top of its \colpage{} with \!\topskip! and
% thus other columns should do so for the stuff following the point.
% Therefore, we put $\cc_c(\vb^b)$ as the last top float, namely
% {\em\Uidx\mvlfloat} because it is for the main vertical list, acquiring an
% \!\insert! from \!\@freelist! by \!\@next! and assigning it to
% \Midx{\!\pcol@float!} so that we pretend main vertical lists of all
% columns are empty.
% 
% The float has zero height and depth, and contains the
% followings if we have some real floats; a vertical skip of $-\!\floatsep!$
% to go back to the bottom of the last real float; \!\topfigrule! and a skip
% of \!\textfloatsep! to separate $\cc_c(\vb^b)$ from the last real float;
% and $\cc_c(\vb^b)$ followed by \!\vss! to avoid overfull and underfull.
% Otherwise, i.e., we don't have any real floats, neither of the skips nor
% \!\topfigrule! are put in the \mvlfloat{} because we let
% $\!\floatsep!=\!\textfloatsep!=0$ and $\!\topfigrule!=\!\relax!$
% temporarily in a group.  Then we set the \sync{}ation point by enlarging
% the space below the \mvlfloat{} so that the total size of all floats
% including \!\floatsep! and \!\textfloatsep!, which may be 0 as set in the
% process above, is equal to $\VT$.  This enlarging is done by letting
% $\cc_c(\tf)=\VT-(\vc(t)-\!\textfloatsep!+\!\floatsep!)$, the second term
% of which is the vertical size of the top float sequence up to the

% float insertion process in \!\pcol@cflt! so that the top floats including

% 
% This enlarging cannot be done by making the float's height
% $\VT-\vc(t)-\!\floatsep!$ (or \!\textfloatsep!) because the height can be
% negative.}.
% 
% Note that the process above involves \!\floatsep! and \!\textfloatsep!
% with some finite stretch and shrink, but these factors will not contribute
% the final result because they are canceled by \!\vss! in the \mvlfloat{}
% and by the small inifinite stretch and shrink put by \!\pcol@makecol! and
% this macro for flushing.  Also note that $\cc_c(\tf)$ is then biased by
% 10000\,|pt| so that \!\pcol@cflt!  will not put \!\topfigrule! because it
% has been already put as a part of the \mvlfloat{} or we don't have any
% real floats.  We also let $\cc_c(\pd)=1000$ to mean the \colpage{}'s main
% vertical list is empty, so as to mimic \TeX's mechanism of \!\prevdepth!
% with an empty list again.
% 
% Another attention we have to pay is that \colpage{}s with
% $\cc_c(\tf)=\infty$ does not have any \sync{}ation points, and thus

% The third and last case is for $\DT<\infty$ and thus most usual.  In this
% case, we enclose everything in $\cc_c(\vb^b)$ in a \!\vbox!  whose height
% is $h_c^v=\VT-\vc(t)$ and let $\cc_c(\vb^b)$ have it so that the item
% following the \sync{}ation point start at $\VT$.  An attention we have to
% pay is that it can be $h_c^v<\!\topskip!$ to let \TeX{} insert a vertical
% skip of the difference between them when the box is returned to the main
% vertical list pushing down the \sync{}ation point a little bit\footnote{
% 
% This can happen not very unlikely especially with $\vc(t)$ a little bit
% less than $\VT$ and $\cc_c(\vb^b)$ being empty.}.
% 
% Therefore, if so, we let $\cc_c(\vb^b)$ have the followings; a \!\vbox! of
% \!\topskip! tall having its old contents at its top above which no
% vertical skip will be inserted; a vertical skip $-\!\topskip!$ going back
% to the page top; and a vertical skip $h_c^v$ going down to the
% \sync{}ation point.
% 
% The encapsulation of the old contents $\cc_c(\vb^b)$ in the box of $h_c^v$
% tall gives us the following two features desirable for \sync{}ation.
% First, all vertical glues in the box are {\em frozen}, nullifying finite
% stretches in them because we insert an infinite stretch of
% $1/10000\,|fil|$ at the bottom of $\cc_c(\vb^b)$ to push up its old
% contents respecting other infinite stretches if any, as done by
% \!\raggedbottom!, and also nullifying finite and infinite shrinks because
% $h_c^v\geq\vc(m)$ definitely.  This freezing and nullification keeps
% \sync{}ation points already in $\cc_c(\vb^b)$ from being observed moving a
% little bit vertically.  That is, if we have a glue just below a
% \sync{}ation point and it were {\em visible} to \TeX's page builder, the
% item below the glue could move up/down when the builder found a break
% point with some shrink\slash stretch.  Though this moving up/down is
% inhibited by the small infinite stretch\slash shrink which the \colpage{}
% will at its bottom finally, it is undesirable to make \TeX{}
% misunderstanding that the glues are strethable\slash shrinkable though
% they are not in reality.
% 
% Second, since the boxes in all \colpage{} are zero deep due to the
% infinite stretch at their bottoms and these bottoms are aligned at the
% \sync{}ation point, we have a clear view of the baseline progress after
% the \sync{}ation regardless of their contents.  That is, we let
% $\cc_c(\pd)=\DT$ to {\em broadcast} $\DT$ to all columns, so that 
% the baselines of first items following the \sync{}ation
% point are aligned \!\baselineskip! below the bottom baseline of the column
% which defines $\DT$\footnote{
% 
% Since $\DT$ is given by one of the tallest columns whose depth is smallest
% among them, it is very likely that the bottom baseline of the column is
% lowest among all columns.  However, another column can have the lowest one
% when its vertical size is a little bit shorter than $\VT$ and its depth is
% small (e.g., 0).  Though of course we can define $\DT$ being $\VT$ minus
% the height of the column having the largest height to make the first
% baseline below the \sync{}ation point apart from the lowest one by
% \cs{baselineskip}, we dare to choose the definition of $\DT$ because such
% lowest baseline often means that the column have some skip at its bottom
% to give us the impressoin that the space between the baselines of the
% tallest column and its first item is a little bit too large.},
% 
% if $\DT$ plus the hight of each item is less than \!\baselineskip!.
% 
% In addition, we let $\cc_c(\tf)=\!\textfloatsep!$ to
% indicate the \colpage{} has the \sync{}ation point we just have set, if it
% was $\infty$ to mean the point is the first one.  By this setting,
% \!\pcol@makecol! and this macro itself will know that the \colpage{} needs
% to have a small infinite shrink at its bottom to cancel finite ones below
% the \sync{}ation point, while \!\pcol@cflt! acts as \LaTeX's \!\@cflt!
% because it should be $\cc_c(\tf)\leq5000\,|pt|$ to mean the \colpage{}

% $\VPP=-\infty$, we must let $\!\@outputbox!=\bot$ (and

% shipped out.  On the other hand, if $\pp^i(\ptop)\neq\bot$ or
% $\pp^f(\ptop)\neq\bot$ while $\VPP=-\infty$, we build a full size page as
% usual but letting $\!\@textbottom!=\!\vfil!$ temporarily to avoid underfull
% in the process of building columns.  Note that if $\pp^f(\ptop)\neq\bot$,
% the \Scfnote{}s are always put into \!\@outputbox! regardless

% we also remove the last skip being \!\dbltextfloatsep! so that those

% Then we do the similar procedure for \!\pcol@rightpage! and make its height

% If \pwise{} floats become a part of \postenv's floats, \!\pcol@rightpage!

% Next, after \!\global!ly letting $\CSIndex{ifpcol@firstpage}=\false$ because
% we will ship a page which may be the \spage{} shortly, we build the
% ship-out image of columns if required fundamentally by
% $\CSIndex{if@tempswa}=\true$.  First,
% if the page $\ptop$ has \Scfnote{}s, we shrink
% $\!\@colht!=\pp^h(\ptop)$ by \!\pcol@shrinkcolbyfn! to keep the room for
% the footnotes, to have $H$ being the possibly shrunk $\pp^h(\ptop)$ whose
% original value without shrinkage is saved in \!\@pageht! for the reference
% in \!\pcol@imakeflushedpage!.  Second, if
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@lastpage}=\true$ but $\CSIndex{ifpcol@dfloats}=\true$
% too, we turn $\CSIndex{ifpcol@lastpage}=\false$ because we need a
% full-sized \lpage{}, temporarily letting $\!\@textbottom!=\!\vfil!$ if
% $\VPP=-\infty$ to avoid underfull due to perfectly empty \colpage{}s as
% discussed in\Tie(\ref{item:mfp-last-dfloats})\footnote{
% 
% Each \colpage{} $cc_c(\vb^b)$ itself exists because the empty \colpage{}
% has been visited by \cscan{} prior to \!\output! request for environment
% closing.}.
% 
% Third, if we are working on a truly \lpage{} and $\arg{ht}<H$ to mean the
% tallest column is shorter than $H$, we let $\!\@colht!=\arg{ht}$ to let
% \!\@makecol! build short \colpage{}s.  Note that it is definitely
% $\arg{ht}\leq H$ because the \pfcheck{} on the \lpage{} makes that sure.
% Fourth and finally, unless all columns in truly \lpage{} are empty as
% discussed in (\ref{item:mfp-last-empty}), we invoke
% $\!\pcol@imakeflushedpage!\<\Cfrom\>\<\Cto\>\<b\>$ once or twice, to put
% columns in right \parapag{}e to $b=\!\pcol@rightpage!$ with
% $\LBRP\Cfrom\Cto=\LBRP\CL\C$ if $\CL<\C$, and then to put left ones in
% $b=\!\@outputbox!$ with $\LBRP\Cfrom\Cto=\LBRP0\CL$ always\footnote{

% 
% The macro $\!\pcol@imakeflushedpage!\<\Cfrom\>\<\Cto\>\arg{b}$ is invoked
% solely in \!\pcol@makeflushedpage! but can be twice with
% $(\Cfrom,\Cto,b)=(\CL,\C,\!\pcol@rightpage!)$ if \parapag{}ing is in effect
% and with $(\Cfrom,\Cto,b)=(0,\CL,\!\@outputbox!)$ always, to build the
% ship-out image of the right or left \parapag{}e $\ptop$ in the box $b$
% already having \spanning{} or its blank counterpart if any, respectively.
% 
% After opening the \!\vbox! of the ship-out image for $b$, at first we
% examine if $\CSIndex{ifpcol@paired}={\false}$ and $\Cfrom>0$, and if so we
% temporarily increment $\page(\ptop)$ by one so that we check its parity
% for \mirror{}ed \bgpaint{} correctly.  Then if the page $\ptop$ has
% \Scfnote{}s in $\pp^f(\ptop)$, we paint its \bground, or that of its blank
% counterpart, by \!\pcol@bg@paintbox! \!\def!ining the parameter
% \!\pcol@bg@footnoteheight!  with the height-plus-depth of $\pp^f(\ptop)$,
% as the very first element of the ship-out image as done in
% \!\pcol@ioutputelt!, if $\ptop$ is not the \lpage{} for which the
% \bgpaint{} is done in \!\pcol@output@end!.  Then we put \spanning{} in $b$
% itself if any.
% 
% Next, we invoke \!\pcol@buildcolseprule! for \cseprule{} drawing and
% \bgpaint{} giving it $H$ in \!\@colht! possibly shurnk from $\pp^h(\ptop)$
% by \Scfnote{}s, $\LBRP\Cfrom\Cto$ for the set of columns to be put, and
% \!\@maxdepth! for non-\lpage{}s to paint the \bground{}s of columns and
% \csepgap{}s so that those of the last segment reach the page bottom, while
% for \lpage{} we give 0 to let the bottom be the real bottom of the
% columns.  Then we put the painted \bground{}s in \!\@tempboxa!
% immediately.

% $\!\footins!=\cc_c(\ft)$ by \!\pcol@getcurrfoot! returning it to
% \!\@freelist! if $c$ has \Mcfnote{}s.
% 
% After that we examine if $\cc_c(\tr)=\infty$ to mean we are working on the
% \lpage{} and the \colpage{} is for a \fcolumn{} whose floats can be put as
% top floats, and let $\!\topfigrule!=\!\relax!$ temporarily because the
% floats are not top ones in reality, if so.  Note that the abnormal setting
% $\cc_c(\tr)=\infty$ is not recovered because it will never be referred to
% and the register \!\@toproom! it represents will be updated with correct

% 
% to have the ship-out image of the \colpage{} in \!\@outputbox!, possibily
% only for the deferred floats in $\cc_c(\tl)$ but without \!\topfigrule! in
% this case.  Note that we don't take care of the stretch\slash shrink of
% \!\skip!\!\footins!  for \Scfnote{}s because \pfcheck{} on the \colpage{}
% makes it sure that the natural height of the \colpage{} cannot be greater
% than \!\@colht!.  Also note that we give \!\@maxdepth! to
% \!\pcol@@makecol! for non-\lpage{}s for depth capping, but for the
% \lpage{} we pass 0 to the macro because $H=\!\@colht!$ should be large
% enough to accommodate everything in the column including its last box even
% if the box is unusually deep.
% 
% Then we put the \!\@outputbox! above in a \!\hbox! of \!\columnwidth! wide
% preceded by \!\pcol@@hfil! being \!\relax! for the first column, while
% it is $\!\pcol@hfil!\<c^g\>$, where $c^g=\!\pcol@colsepid!$ being $c$ or
% $c-1$ without or with \cswap{} respectively, to put a \csepgap{} possibly
% with \cseprule{} segments in \!\pcol@tempbox! built by
% \!\pcol@buildcolseprule!.  Finally, we save \cctext{} especially those
% for float parameters into $\cc_c$ by \!\pcol@setcurrcolnf! because all

% The macro \!\pcol@flushfloats! is invoked from \!\pcol@output@clear! and
% \!\pcol@output@end! to flush all deferred \cwise{} floats in each
% column if any.  After letting $\!\@colht!=\!\textheight!$ for
% \fcolumn{}s, we iterate shipping out a page having \fcolumn{}s while
% $\CSIndex{if@fcolmade}=\exists c\In0\C:(\cc_c(\dl)\neq())$.
% 
% In the loop, we initialize $\CSIndex{if@fcolmade}=\false$, and then
% invoke \!\pcol@iflushfloats! twice or once according to $\CL<\C$ or not to
% mean \parapag{}ing is in effect or not, respectively.  That is, if
% $\CL<\C$ we invoke the macro with $\LBRP\CL\C$ and \!\pcol@rightpage! for
% the right \parapag{}e, and do it with $\LBRP0\CL$ and \!\@outputbox!
% always.  Note that if $\CL=\C$, we let $\!\pcol@rightpage!=\bot$ to tell
% \!\@outputpage!, which we invoke at the end of the loop to ship out a page
% or a \parapag{}e pair, that the \parapag{}ing is not in effect.
% 
% The macro $\!\pcol@iflushfloats!\<\Cfrom\>\<\Cto\>\<b\>$ opens
% a \!\vbox! to be set into $b$.  Then if $\CSIndex{ifpcol@paired}={\false}$
% and $\Cfrom>0$ to mean we are working on a right \npaired{} \parapag{}e,
% we temporarily add \!\c@page! by one for page parity examination for
% \mirror{}ed \bgpaint.  Then, the macro \!\pcol@buildcolseprule! is invoked
% with $\!\@colht!=\!\textheight!$ and $\LBRP\Cfrom\Cto$ for \cseprule{}
% drawing in \!\pcol@tempbox! and \bgpaint{} for columns and \csepgap{}s in
% \!\@tempboxa! put into $b$ immediately.
% 
% Then we open a \!\hbox! of \!\textwidth! wide and initialize
% $f=\CSIndex{if@tempswa}$ to be \CSIndex{if@fcolmade}.  Then for each
% $c\In\Cfrom\Cto$, being $c'$ or $\C-1-c'$ for the $c'$-th iteration
% determined by \!\pcol@swapcolumn! according to the effectiveness of
% \cswap{} and the parity of \!\c@page!, we put an inner \!\hbox! of
% $\!\columnwidth!=\w_c$ wide preceded by \!\pcol@@hfil! being \!\relax! at
% initial or $\!\pcol@hfil!\<c_g\>$ otherwise for a \csepgap{} and
% \cseprule{}, where $c_g\in\{c,c{-}1\}$ without or with \cswap{}
% respectively.  That is, at first we obtain $c$'s \cctext{} including
% $\cc_c(\dl)$ by \!\pcol@getcurrcol!  and pass $\cc_c(\dl)$ to
% \!\@makefcolumn! to produce a \fcolumn{} in \!\@outputbox!  to be put into
% the inner \!\hbox!.  Then we do $f\gets f\lor(\cc_d(\dl)\neq\emptyset)$
% with $\cc_d(\dl)$ shrunk by \!\@makefcolumn! to let $f$ have
% $\exists{}c\In0\Cto:(\cc_c(\dl)\neq\emptyset)$ at the end of the loop for
% $c$, and then save the \cctext{} into $\cc_c$ by \!\pcol@setcurrcolnf!
% because we have no footnotes in $c$.
% 
% After the end of the loop, we move $f$ to \CSIndex{if@fcolmade} for

% The macro \!\pcol@freshpage! is invoked from \!\pcol@output@flush! and
% \!\pcol@output@clear! to start a new page after column flushing.  At
% first, we let $p=\pbase=\ptop=0$ and $\PP=\emptyset$ because we know no
% pages are kept.  Then we invoke \!\pcol@startpage! to start a new page
% with a \!\def!inition of $\!\pcol@currpage!=|{}|$ to indicate the invoker
% is this macro (i.e., not \!\pcol@opcol!).  Then after keeping \!\@colht!
% in $h=\!\pcol@colht!$, we do the followings for each column $c\In0\C$.
% 
% First we obtain $c$'s \cctext{} in $\cc_c$ by \!\pcol@getcurrcol! but let
% $p=0$ and $\!\@colroom!=h$, which can be modified by $c'<c$, without
% referring to $\cc_c(\vb^p)$ nor $\cc_c(\vb^r)$ because they are obsolete.
% We also save \!\@currbox! to \Midx{\!\pcol@currboxsave!} because it may be
% modified by \!\pcol@opcol! if we make \fcolumn{}s afterward.  Then we invoke
% \!\pcol@getcurrpage! to have the \pctext{} of $p=0$, because it might be
% modified by a column $c'<c$ by producing \fcolumn{}s.  After that and the
% invocation of \!\pcol@floatplacement! for setting float parametners, we
% invoke \!\pcol@startcolumn! for $c$'s \colpage{} at $p=0$, and interate
% \!\pcol@opcol! and \!\pcol@startcolumn! while a \fcolumn{} is made by the
% latter\footnote{
% 
% Each column can have deferred floats on the invocation from
% \!\pcol@output@flush!.}.
% 
% Note that we give the argument 0 to each invocation of
% \!\pcol@startcolumn! to keep it from inserting deferred \Scfnote{}s, which
% will be taken care of by \!\pcol@restartcolumn! if any.  At last in the
% loop, we restore \!\@currbox! from \!\pcol@currboxsave!, let
% $\cc_c(\vb^b)$ be an empty \!\vbox! because the main vertical list is
% empty, and save the \cctext{} into $\cc_c$ by \!\pcol@setcurrcolnf!
% because of no footnotes obviously, after saving $p$ and \!\@colroom!,
% which might be modified by the \fcolumn{} production, into $\cc_c(\vb^p)$
% and $\cc_c(\vb^r)$.
% 
% After the loop above, finally we invoke \!\pcol@restartcolumn! to return
% to the column in which \!\flushpage! or \!\clearpage! was issued.

% 
% The macro \!\pcol@output@end! is invoked solely from
% \!\pcol@specialoutput! to process the \!\output! request made by
% \!\endparacol!.  We invoke \!\pcol@makeflushedpage! for the \lpage{}
% production as the setting $\CSIndex{ifpcol@lastpage}=\true$ done by
% \!\endparacol! indicates, giving it $h=\!\pcol@colht!$ in which
% \!\pcol@sync! sets the height of the tallest \colpage{} to have the
% ship-out image of the \tpage{} in \!\@outputbox!.
% 
% Next, we define $\mpbout=\!\pcol@mparbottom@out!$ as follows.  First, we
% invoke \!\pcol@getmparbottom@last! giving it $y=\VPP-\!\ht!\!\@outputbox!$
% being the negative counterpart of
% the height of \spanning{} in the \lpage, to let $\mpbout$ have the occupancy
% information of the bottom marginal note in each margin if any, or
% $\mpar(y,y)$ otherwise.  Then we transform $y$-coordinates in $\mpbout$
% from those for columns to those for text area by
% $\!\pcol@bias@mpbout!\Arg{-y}$ to have the final result.  Then to pass
% \!\@mparbottom! for post-environment typesetting,
% 
% \Index{post-environment stuff}
% 
% we invoke \!\pcol@do@mpbout! \!\def!ining \!\pcol@do@mpbout@whole! to do
% nothing and \!\pcol@do@mpbout@elem! to let $\!\@mparbottom!=b$ where
% $\mpb_L^x=(\mpar(t,b))$ and $x\in\{l,r\}$ according to the margin which
% post-environment marginal notes go to.

% Next we process one of the following cases.
% 
% The first case is for $\CSIndex{ifpcol@dfloats}=\true$ to mean the

% \lpage in {\em full size} in \!\@outputbox! unless the page has nothing
% perfectly.  Therefore, we ship the image out by \!\@outputbox! unless it
% is $\bot$ for perfectly empty case.  Then we invoke \!\pcol@flushfloats!
% to produce and ship out \fpage{}s, lettinng $\CSIndex{if@fcolmade}={\true}$
% to tell the macro that at least we will have one \fpage{}.  Now we have
% shipped out everyting in the closing environment and thus we let
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@output}=\false$ to tell \!\output! routine to work
% ordinarily.  Then we let $\CSIndex{if@tempswa}=f_{\it sp}=\true$ to
% remember we will start a new page and thus $\!\@pagedp!=\pd=\DP=1000$ to
% mimic \TeX's \!\prevdepth! mechanism.  Finally we let
% $\CSIndex{@mparbottom}=0$ and $\mpbout=\mpboutz$ because no marginal notes
% are carried over to post-environment typesetting.

%    \end{macrocode}
% 
% Before proceeding to the second and third cases, we let
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@output}=\false$ because we have nothing to ship out.
% 
% Then the second case is for $h=-\infty$ without deferred \cwise{}
% floats to mean all columns in the \lpage{} are empty and the page does not
% have non-merged \Scfnote{}s.  In this case, we examine if
% $\Midx{\!\pcol@firstprevdepth!}=\!\relax!$ to mean we have had at least
% one new page in \env{paracol} environment, i.e., \!\pcol@startpage! have
% been invoked at least once.  If so, we let $f_{\it sp}=\true$, $\pd=1000$,
% $\!\@mparbottom!=0$ and $\mpbout=\mpboutz$ again and put nothing to the
% main vertical list so that the \postenv{} starts from the top of the page.
% However, we have to take care of the case that $f_{\it ns}=\false$ and
% thus \!\@outputbox!  has \spanning.  If so, we acquire an \!\insert! from
% \!\@freelist! by \!\@next! to let it have the \spanning, i.e., the
% contents of \!\@outputbox!\footnote{
% 
% It does not have \!\dbltextfloatsep! at its tail because the skip has been
% removed by \!\pcol@makeflushedpage!.}.
% 
% Then the \!\insert! is added to the head of \!\@dbldeferlist! with the
% float placement code 10 to force \LaTeX's float placement mechanism to put
% it to the page to be started shortly.
% 
% On the other hand, $\!\pcol@firstprevdepth!\neq\!\relax!$ means that it
% has $\!\prevdepth!=\pd'$ just before \beginparacol{} in decimal integer
% representation.  Since we have not started any pages in the environment,
% and all columns in the \lpage{} is empty, we have almost nothing in the
% environment.  Note that the environment can have \pwise{} floats but they
% have not yet put into any pages but are kept in \!\@dbldeferlist!, or
% \Mgfnote{}s but they are merged to those in \postenv.  Therefore, the
% \preenv{} and \postenv{} must be {\em connected} naturally and thus we put
% the \preenv{} kept in \!\@outputbox! to the main vertical list by
% \!\unvbox!, letting $\pd=\pd'$ and keeping $f_{\it sp}=\false$\footnote{
% 
% The author of course know this situation is very unlikely but he is
% monomaniac.}.
% 
% In this case, the setting of \!\@mparbottom! and $\mpbout$ done at the
% beginning of this macro is correct because they describe the marginal
% notes in \preenv{} including \env{paracol} enviroments preceeding it even
% if any.

% 
% The last case without deferred floats and with some non-empty columns or
% non-merged \Scfnote{}s is
% most usual.  In this case, we may simply put \!\@outputbox! letting
% $\!\topskip!=0$ because \!\topskip! has already been inserted in
% \colpage{}s or \preenv{} in the box\footnote{
% 
% If the \lpage{} has non-merged \Scfnote{}s without any other items,
% \cs{topskip} has not been inserted, but this inconsistency without
% \cs{topskip} is acceptable.}.
% 
% However before putting the box back to the main vertical list, we have to
% take care of the \bgpaint{} as follows.  First we let
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@havelastpage}=\true$ to let \!\@outputpage! paint the
% \bground{} of the \postenv{} if the page having the \lpage{} completes.
% Second, we let \!\pcol@bg@preposttop@left! have the height-plus-depth of
% the \!\@outputbox! having the short \lpage{} because the \bground{} of
% \postenv{}, or of \preenv{} if we have another \env{paracol} environment
% in the same page, to be painted is just below the box.  We also
% \!\pcol@bg@preposttop@right! have the same value but only if $\CL<\C$,
% because otherwise we have to keep this macro unchanged so that the
% non-existent right \parapag{}e of the closing environment can be the
% \postenv{} of a preceding environment and/or the \preenv{} of a succeeding
% one with \parapag{}ing.  Note that in the aforementioned {\em fresh page}
% cases and the perfectly empty case, we may be unaware of these macros
% because it should have been made 0 by the last invocation of
% \!\@outputpage! in the fresh page case or the \preenv{} and \postenv{} are
% contiguous in the empty case.
% 
% Third and finally, we have to paint the \bground{} of non-merged
% \Scfnote{}s because the paining is left by \!\pcol@makeflushedpage! for
% this macro.  Therefore, if $\!\pcol@fnheight@lpage!>0$ to mean we have
% footnotes whose total height-plus-depth is in the macro, we paint their
% \bground{} by \!\pcol@bg@paintbox! \!\def!ining \!\pcol@bg@footnoteheight!
% with the size and temporarily re\!\def!ining \!\pcol@bg@textheight! to be
% the height-plus-depth of \!\@outputbox!  because the foontnotes are at the
% bottom of the box instead of the page.  Note that the order of painting is
% right first and then left second if we have \parapag{}es because we refer
% the height-plus-depth of \!\@outputbox! being put into the main vertical
% list making the box $\bot$.  Also note that if the right \parapag{}e is
% \npaired, we temporarily increment \!\c@page! in \!\pcol@rightpage! to let
% \!\pcol@bg@paintbox! handle \bginfext{} to side margins correctly.
% Another remark is that we don't modify $\pd=\!\@pagedp!$ and thus it keeps
% $\DP$ in this case, and $f_{sp}$ is kept $\false$.

%	{Add zero-clearing of \cs{deadcycles}.}
% 
% Before giving the definition of \env{paracol} environment and commands
% used in it, we define the macro $\!\pcol@invokeoutput!\arg{pen}$ invoked
% from them to make an \!\output!-request with \!\penalty! of
% $\arg{pen}=|\pcol@op@|{\cdot}f$.  The macro's structure is similar to that
% for the request sequence in \!\end@float! as follows; insert a \!\penalty!
% of $-10004$ to save the main vertical list in \!\@holdpg!; save
% \!\prevdepth!; insert a \!\vbox! to make it sure the following \!\penalty!
% of $\arg{pen}$ is kept even when we are at the top of a page; and finally
% restore \!\prevdepth!.
% 
% A difference is that we zero-clear \!\deadcycles! because it can be reach
% $\!\maxdeadcycles!=100$ easily if a page has many \sync{}ations and many
% columns.  Another and more important difference is in the save\slash
% restore of \!\prevdepth!.  First, the value of the register is saved in
% our own \!\pcol@prevdepth! instead of \!\@tempdima! by a \!\global!
% assignment so that \!\output!-routine refers to it\footnote{
% 
% The assignment is not necessary to be done \!\global!ly but we dare to do
% it to make all assignments to \!\pcol@prevdepth! being \!\global!
% consistently.}.
% 
% Second, the value restored to \!\prevdepth! may be different from that we
% just have saved because \!\output!-routine may update \!\pcol@prevdepth!
% to have, for example, the value saved in $\cc_c(\pd)$ when we left from
% $c$ which we are now restarting.
% 
% In addition to above, after the invocatoin of \!\output!-routine, we let

% 
% The API macro $\!\paracol!|[|\CL|][*]|\Arg{\C}$\oarg{text} is invoked by
% \beginparacol{} to start a \Midx{\env{paracol}} environment.  The macro
% sipmly examines the existence of the optional argument $\CL$, whose
% default value $\C$ is given by \!\pcol@xparacol!, to decide the
% number of columns in left \parapag{}es.  Then if the optional argument is
% given, \!\pcol@yparacol! examines the existence of `|*|' following it for
% \npaired{} \parapag{}ing to let $\CSIndex{ifpcol@paired}=\false$, while
% \!\paracol! gave the default $\true$ for \paired{} one to the switch.
% Then the all other operations to start the environment is doen by
% \!\pcol@zparacol!.
% 
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\paracol{\global\pcol@pairedtrue \@ifnextchar[%]
  \pcol@yparacol\pcol@xparacol}

\def\pcol@yparacol[#1]{%
  \@ifstar{\global\pcol@pairedfalse \pcol@zparacol[#1]}%
          {\pcol@zparacol[#1]}}
%    \end{macrocode}
% 
% In \!\pcol@zparacol!, after making it sure to be in vertical mode by
% \CSIndex{par}, at first we let $\CL$ and $\C$ have the value given through
% the corresponding arguments, unless $\CL>\C$ to let us make $\CL=\C$
% silently.  Then we examine $\CL<\C$, and if not we let
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@paired}=\true$ regardless the setting in
% \!\pcol@yparacol! because \npaired{} typesetting is meaningless without
% \parapag{}ing.  On the other hand, if \npaired{} typesetting is specified,
% we let $\CSIndex{ifpcol@swapcolumn}={\false}$ but {\em not} \!\global!ly
% because \cswap{} is meaningless in \npaired{} mode in the environment now
% starting.
% 
% Second, we perform the operations done by \!\item! if
% $\CSIndex{if@newlist}=\true$ to mean it is the first one in a
% \env{list}-like environment.  That is, we invoke \!\@nbitem! if
% $\CSIndex{if@nobreak}=\true$, or add a penalty \!\@beginparpenalty! and a
% vertical skip $\!\@topsep!-\!\parskip!-\!\itemsep!$ so that the first
% \!\item! is \!\@topsep! apart from the last line above the environment,
% and then let $\CSIndex{if@newlist}=\false$.  The reason why we do these
% operations here is that, if the \env{paracol} environment is enclosed in a
% \env{list}-like environment without anything between two \!\begin! for
% environments, we have to align all first \!\item!s in all columns.  That
% is, if we did not do that, the {\em literally first} \!\item! would do that
% resulting in the column having the \!\item! led by the vertical skip of
% \!\@topsep! while others should have ordinary inter-\!\item! skips.
% Therefore, we perform the operations on behalf of all first \!\item!s in
% all columns to have the skip of \!\@topsep! {\em above} the \env{paracol}
% environment we are opening.

% The third operation group is to set up lists for counters as follows.
% First we obtain $\CC=\!\cl@@ckpt!$ to have all counters defined by
% \!\newcounter! and \counter{page}.  Then we scan $\CG=\!\pcol@gcounters!$
% applying \!\pcol@remctrelt! to each element to have
% $\CTL=\!\pcol@counters!$ for all \lcounter{}s by removing all $\cg\in\CG$
% from $\CC$, and to move $\clist(\cg)=|\cl@|{\cdot}\cg$ to
% $|\pcol@cl@|{\cdot}\cg$ redefining
% $|\cl@|{\cdot}\cg=\!\pcol@stepcounter!\Arg{\cg}$
% 
% \SpecialArrayIndex{\theta}{\cl@}
% 
% to clear descendant \lcounter{}s of $\cg$, i.e., those in $\clist(\cg)$.
% 
% Next we scan $\CTL$ applying \!\pcol@thectrelt! to each element $\cl\in\CTL$
% to let $|\pcol@thectr@|{\cdot}\~\cl=|\the|{\cdot}\cl$
% 
% \SpecialArrayIndex{\theta}{\pcol@thectr@}
% \SpecialArrayIndex{\theta}{\the}
% 
% so that the former has the {\em default} \lrep{} of $\cl$.  The macro
% \!\pcol@thectrelt! also lets
% $|\the|{\cdot}\cl=|\pcol@thectr@|{\cdot}\cl{\cdot}0$
% 
% \SpecialArrayIndex{\theta{\cdot}c}{\pcol@thectr@}
% \SpecialArrayIndex{\theta}{\the}
% 
% if the \lrep{} for $\cl$ and $c=0$ has been defined by
% \!\definethecounter!.  This is necessary because in the first visit to the
% leftmost column 0 we will neither invoke \!\pcol@switchcol! nor thus scan
% $\CTL$ with \!\pcol@setctrelt! which defines \lrep{}s, unless a \mctext{}
% is specified with \beginparacol.
% 
% Next we give the initial value of $\val_c(\cl)$ for each column $c$ and
% \lcounter{} $\cl\in\CTL$ by the followings enclosed in a group.  First we
% scan $\Cc_0$ applying \!\pcol@loadctrelt! to each
% $\cl\in\Cc'_0=\Set{\theta}{\<\theta,\val_0(\theta)\>\in\Cc_0}$ to have
% the value $\val_0(\cl)$ in $|\pcol@ctr@|{\cdot}\cl$
% 
% \SpecialArrayIndex{\theta}{\pcol@ctr@}
% 
% temporarily.  Next we scan $\CTL$ to pick \lcounter{}s $\theta$ such that
% $\Uidx\Val(\theta)\neq\val_0(\theta)$ where $\Val(\theta)$ is the value of
% $\theta$ outside \env{paracol} environment, or $\theta\notin\Cc'_0$, to
% let them be listed in \!\@gtempa!.  That is, we pick \lcounter{}s which
% have been updated or defined after the closing of the previous
% \env{paracol}, or everything in $\CTL$ at the first \beginparacol{} because
% $\Cc_0=\emptyset$\footnote{
% 
% Undefined in fact.}.
% 
% Finally, we invoke \!\pcol@synccounter! giving it \!\@gtempa! as its
% argument to let $\val_c(\theta)=\Val(\theta)$ for all $c$ and for each
% $\theta$ in \!\@gtempa!.  That is, when \env{paracol} environment appears
% two or more times, the value of a \lcounter{} at the beginning of the
% second or succeeding environment is kept unchanged from that at the end of
% the previous environment, unless it has been updated between them.  Note
% that these scans above are enclosed in a group in order to make
% $|\pcol@ctr@|{\cdot}\cl$

% 
% Fourth, we set up a few \LaTeX's typesetting parameters which should have
% appropriate values in the environment.  We let
% $\CSIndex{if@twocolumn}=\true$ so that \textit{float}|*| environments work
% for \pwise{} floats and LaTeX's \!\@addmarginpar! determine the margin
% for marginal notes by \CSIndex{if@firstcolumn} whose truth value is
% determined by our own \!\@addmarginpar!.  We also let $\!\col@number!=1$
% instead of $\C$ so that its (almost surely) sole user \!\maketitle! will
% not produce the title with \!\twocolumn! which cannot be in the
% environment.
% 
% Then we invoke $\!\pcol@setcolumnwidth!\<\Cfrom\>\<\Cto\>\<r\>\<s\>$ once
% or twice with
% $(\Cfrom,\Cto,r,s)=(0,\CL,\!\pcol@columnratioleft!,\!\pcol@colwidthspecleft!)$
% always for left \parapag{}e, and with
% $(\CL,\C,\!\pcol@columnratioright!,\!\pcol@colwidthspecright!)$ for right
% one if $\CL<\C$ to define column widths $\w_c=|\pcol@columnwidth|{\cdot}c$
% 
% \SpecialArrayIndex{c}{\pcol@columnwidth}

% and that of \csepgap{}s $\gap_c=|\pcol@columnsep|{\cdot}c$
% 
% \SpecialArrayIndex{c}{\pcol@columnsep}
% 
% for all $c\In0\C=\LBRP0\CL\cup\LBRP\CL\C$.
% 
% Then we initialize other variables as follows;
% $\lrm=\!\pcol@lrmargin!=\!\textwidth!-\!\linewidth!$ so that, if $\lrm>0$,
% \!\linewidth! for $c$ has $\w_c-\lrm$ reflecting the paragraph shape of the
% \env{list}-like environment surrounding \env{paracol} environment;
% $\!\pcol@topskip!=\!\topskip!$ for the second and succeeding pages;
% $\!\pcol@textfloatsep!=\infty$ to mean we don't have any \sync{}ation
% points so far; $\CSIndex{ifpcol@lastpage}=\false$ because the \spage{} is
% not the last so far; and $\!\pcol@firstprevdepth!=\!\prevdepth!$ in
% decimal integer form for the extreme empty case.
% 
% We also make the macro \Midx{\!\@combinefloats!} \!\let!-equal to our own
% \!\pcol@combinefloats!  throughout the environment, after saving its
% original definition into \Midx{\!\pcol@@combinefloats!} for processing
% \!\output! request sneaked from outsied of environment, so that our
% customization is in effect for any invocations including those from
% \LaTeX's own macros.  Similarly, \!\@addmarginpar! is made \!\let!-equal
% to our own \!\pcol@addmarginpar!  while its orginal definition is saved
% into \!\pcol@@addmarginpar! but in this case we need the original for the
% implementaion of our own.  On the other hand, \!\end@dblfloat! is simply
% replaced with our own \!\pcol@end@dblfloat! being what \LaTeX{} had had until
% 2014 as discussed in item-(\ref{item:ovv-float-end@dblfloat}) of

% Fifth, we save the original definition of \!\set@color! into
% \!\pcol@set@color!, and then examine if $\!\set@color!\neq\!\relax!$
% meaning some coloring package is loaded.  If any coloring packages are not
% loaded, we make macros for \bgpaint{}, namely \!\pcol@bg@paintpage!,
% \!\pcol@bg@paintcolumns! and \!\pcol@bg@paintbox!, \!\let!-equal to
% \!\relax! for the first two and to \!\@gobble! for the last so that they do
% nothing without coloring package.
% 
% If the coloring is enabled, on the other hand, we redefine \LaTeX's
% \!\set@color!  so that it works as \!\pcol@set@color@push!  with
% \colorstack.  We also prepare the text colring mechanism to let
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@inner}=\true$ in every \!\vbox! in the \env{paracol}
% environment as follows.  First, we let $\CSIndex{ifpcol@inner}=\false$
% because we are not in any \!\vbox!es obviously.  Then, to use
% \!\everyvbox! for our own pupose, we do the followings; (1) \!\global!ly
% assign a token \Midx{\!\pcol@dummytoken!}, which should never occurs, to
% \!\pcol@everyvbox!; (2) save \!\everyvbox!  into \!\pcol@everyvbox!
% locally; (3) let \!\everyvbox! have a \!\the!-reference to
% \!\pcol@everyvbox! and |\pcol@innerture| to let
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@inner}={\true}$; and then (4) make \!\everyvbox!
% \!\let!-equal to \!\pcol@everyvbox!.  By the last operation (4), any
% \!\everyvbox! appearing in the \env{paracol} environment is replaced with
% \!\pcol@everyvbox! to keep the real \!\everyvbox! from modified nullifying
% our own operation |\pcol@innertrue|.  On the other hand, since both
% \!\everyvbox!  and \!\pcol@everyvbox! are registers to hold tokens and
% thus any operations applicable to \!\everyvbox! are also applicable to
% \!\pcol@everyvbox!, any updates on \!\everyvbox! and explicit references
% to it are simulated by \!\pcol@everyvbox!.  Then the initial tokens given
% to \!\pcol@everyvbox!  by the saving operation (2) or tokens given inside
% the environment are correctly processed whenever a \!\vbox! is opened,
% toghether with |\pcol@innertrue| to fulfill our own purpose, because the
% real \!\everyvbox! is let have a \!\the!-reference to \!\pcol@everyvbox!
% by (3).  We also reserve the invocation of \!\pcol@restoreeveryvbox! by
% \!\aftergroup! so that the macro is invoked just after \Endparacol{} to
% examine if any \!\global! assignments to \!\everyvbox! has been made in
% the environment.  The funny \!\global!  assignment (1) is done for this
% examination so that we detect global assignments done in the environment
% having been closed because they should have changed the global value of
% \!\pcol@everyvbox! to something different from \!\pcol@dummytoken!.
% 
% Then we continue the case having some coloring package to make \bgpaint{}
% macros \!\pcol@bg@paintpage!, \!\pcol@bg@paintbox! and
% \!\pcol@bg@paintcolumns! activated by making them \!\let!-equal to thier
% |@@| counterparts namely \!\pcol@bg@@paintpage!, \!\pcol@bg@@paintbox! and
% \!\pcol@bg@paintcolumns! which implement \bgpaint{}.
% 
% Finally we empty \colorstack{}s $\cst=\!\pcol@colorstack!$ and
% $\cstshadow={}$\!\pcol@colorstack@shadow! and the pushing list
% $\cstb=\!\pcol@colorstack@buf!$ to give them initial states regardless of
% the availability of coloring package.

% and then subtract $g^n_{m-1}$ and $g^f_{m-1}$ from them to have $W$ and
% $F$.  Note that $F$ is represented by a dimension with the unit of pt by

% 
% The macro
% $\!\pcol@setcw@getspec!\<w'_d\>|/|\<g'_d\>|/|\arg{garbage}\!\@nil!$ is
% used solely in \!\pcol@setcw@scan! to parse a column\slash gap
% specification $s_d=|[|w'_d|][/[|g'_d|]]|$, to extract factors $w_d^n$,
% $w_d^f$, $g_d^n$ and $g_d^f$, and to process width factors by
% \!\pcol@setcw@c! and gap factors by \!\pcol@setcw@s!.  Since the macro is
% invoked with arguments in the form of $s_d|//|\!\@nil!$, if $s_d$ has
% `|/|' in it $w'_d$ and $g'_d$ should have everything preceeding and
% following the `|/|' respectively while $\arg{garbage}$ should have the
% redundant `|/|'.   Otherwise, i.e., if $s_d$ does not have `|/|',
% $w'_d=s_d$ and $g'_d=\emptyset$ while $\arg{garbage}=\emptyset$\footnote{
% 
% If $s_d$ have two or more `|/|', everything following the second one is
% thrown away into $\arg{garbage}$ together with `|//|'.  Therefore we could
% check if $s_d$ has at most one `|/|' by examining $\arg{garbage}$ but we
% abandon it simply ingoring $\arg{garbage}$.}.
% 
% Therefore, we invoke $\!\pcol@setcw@getspec@i!\arg{default}\Arg{x'_d}$ twice
% with $(\arg{default},x'_d)=(\!\fill!,w'_d)$ for a column and
% $(\arg{default},x'_d)=(\!\columnsep!,g'_d)$ for a gap, and \!\pcol@setcw@c!
% and \!\pcol@setcw@s! after each invocation respectively.
% 
% In this macro, at first we scan all tokens in $x'_d$ by \!\@tfor! to
% remove all space tokens in it\footnote{
% 
% A proper skip specification and ``$f\!\fill!$'' is always proper without
% space tokens in them.}.
% 
% Then if $x'_d$ after the space removal has nothing, we let
% $x'_d=\arg{default}$.  Next we examine if $x'_d=f\!\fill!$ in a trickey
% way by temporarily \!\let!ting $\!\@gtempa!=\!\relax!$, defining \!\fill!
% as ``|1pt|\!\gdef!\!\@gtempa!|{}|'' and making an assignment
% ``\!\@tempskipa!  $x'_d$''.  That is, if $x'_d=f\!\fill!$, \!\@tempskipa!
% will have $f{\cdot}|1pt|$ being a proper dimension and \!\@gtempa! is made
% empty.  Otherwise, \!\@tempskipa! should have $x'_d$ which must be a
% proper skip and \!\@gtempa! remains unchanged from \!\relax!.  Therefore,
% if $\!\@gtempa!=\!\relax!$ we let $\!\@tempskipa!=x'_d$ again\footnote{
% 
% Because the first assignment is done in a group.}.
% 
% Otherwise, we invoke $\!\pcol@setcw@fill!\;x'_d\!\@nil!$ to let
% \!\@tempskipa! have $0\,|pt|\ |plus|\ f\,|fil|$ where $f$ is replaced by 1
% if $f=\emptyset$.
% 
% Now \!\@tempskipa! has $x_d^n$ as its natural component and may have some
% infinite strectch component $x_d^f$ specified explicitly or with \!\fill!.
% Therefore, we assign \!\@tempskipa! to \!\@tempdima! so that it has
% $x_d^n$, and then, after adding 0\,|pt| |plus| 1000\,|pt| |minus|
% 1000\,|pt| to \!\@tempskipa! to make it sure it has both strech and shrink
% components\footnote{
% 
% Almost sure becaues they could be $-1000$\,pt, but we ignore the
% possibility.}
% 
% keeping infinite stretch factor if any, invoke \!\pcol@extract@fil! giving
% it \!\the!-expansion of \!\@tempskipa! as the argument to let
% $\!\@tempdimb!=x_d^f\times\!\pcol@setcw@filunit!$.

% The macro \!\pcol@setcw@calcfactors! is used solely in
% \!\pcol@setcolwidth@s! to calculate $\phi_s=\!\pcol@setcw@scale!$ and
% $\phi_f=\!\dimen@ii!$ as follows
% $$
% (\phi_s,\phi_f)=\cases{(\WT/\W,\;0)& $W\geq\WT\;\lor\;F\leq0$\cr
%                        (1,\;(\WT-W)/F)&$W<WT\;\land\;F>0$}
% $$
% where $W=\!\dimen@!$, $F\times1\,|pt|=\!\dimen@ii!$ and $\WT=\!\textwidth!$,
% and $\phi_s=1$ is represented by empty body of \!\pcol@setcw@scale!.
% First we deal with the special and trivial case of $W=\WT$ to let
% $\phi_s=1$ and $\phi_f=0$ so as to avoid arithmetic error in the
% calculation of $\WT/W$.  If $W\neq\WT$ on the other hand, we calculate
% $\WT/W$ by $\!\pcol@setcw@calcf!\<\WT\>\<W\>\<\phi_s\>$ to have a
% provisional result.  Then if $W<\WT$ and $F>0$, we let $\phi_s=1$ and
% invoke \!\pcol@setcw@calcf! again giving it $(\WT-W)$ and $F\times1\,|pt|$
% but throw away the result $(\WT-W)/(F\times1\,|pt|)$ because \!\@tempdimb!
% should have $(\WT-W)/F$ which is then set into $\phi_f=\!\dimen@ii!$.
% Otherwise, we keep the provisional result of $\phi_s$ as the final one and
% let $\phi_f=\!\dimen@ii!=0$.
% 
% The macro $\!\pcol@setcw@calcf!\<x\>\<y\>\<z\>$ caclulates $z\approx x/y$
% and let $\!\@tempdimb!=Z=z\times1\,|pt|$ as follows.  First we find the
% following three parameters.
% 
% \begin{eqnarray*}
% k_1&=&\min\Set{k}{k\geq0,\;x\cdot2^k\geq2^{13}\,|pt|}\\
% k_2&=&\max\Set{k}{y\bmod2^k=0}\\
% k_3&=&\min\Set{k}{k\geq0,\;\lceil y/2^{k_2+k}\rceil\leq2^{15}}
% \end{eqnarray*}
% 
% With these parameters, we calculate $z'=\lfloor(x\cdot2^{k_1})/\lceil
% y/2^{k_2+k_3}\rceil\rfloor$ to have a good approximation of
% $(x/y)\cdot2^{k}$ where $k=k_1+k_2+k_3$ without arithmetic overflow.  Then
% if $z'/2^k\geq2^{14}$ or in other words $Z$ is larger than \!\maxdimen!,
% we complain that by \!\PackageError! and, in case a user dare to
% continue the typesetting process, we let $Z=10000\,|pt|$.  Otherwise, we
% calculate $Z=(z'/2^k)\cdot2^{16}=z'\cdot2^{16-k}$ to have it in
% \!\@tempdimb! by $Z=z'\times2^{16-k}$ if $k<16$, or by $Z=z'/2^{k-16}$
% otherwise.  Finally we invoke \!\pcol@extract@pt! giving it
% \!\the!-representaion of $Z$ to have $z$.
% 
% Note that it is assured $z\leq x/y$ regardless of successfulness of the
% calculation and thus the scaling $\phi_s x_d^n$ and strething
% $x_d^n+\phi_f x_d^f$ cannot exceed their exact value to make it also sure
% that $\sum_{c=\Cfrom}^{\Cto-2}(\w_c+\gap_c)+\w_{\Cto-1}\leq\WT$ and thus
% the series of columns and \csepgap{}s should not cause overfull when a
% page is shipped out with \!\hfil! added to each \csepgap{} for underfull
% avoidance.

% Before giving the definition of \cswitch{} commands and environments, we

% The macro $\!\pcol@sptext!|[|\arg{text}|]|$ is invoked from
% \!\pcol@zparacol! and \!\pcol@iswitchcolumn! to put a \Uidx\mctext{}
% $\arg{text}$ given as the optional argument of the former or that of
% \!\switchcolumn!|*| and its relative envrironment openers for the latter.
% The macro has \!\long!  attribute because the \mctext{} may have
% \CSIndex{par}.  Since the text is put in the column-0 regardless of its
% physical position, we let \!\pcol@nextcol!  have 0 after saving the target
% column $d=\!\pcol@nextcol!$ in \!\@tempcnta!.  Then we switch to the
% column by \!\pcol@switchcol!, after turning $\CSIndex{ifpcol@sync}=\true$
% to set a \sync{}ation point above the text and
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@sptextstart}=\true$ to tell \!\pcol@output@switch! to
% prepare the capture of \mctext{} saveing the \prespan{}.
% 
% Next, we let $\CSIndex{ifpcol@sptextstart}=\false$ and
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@sptext}=\true$ to indicate the main vertical list
% contains only the \mctext{} and it is to be captured by \!\output!
% routine.  Then the $\arg{text}$ is put in a group in which we let
% $\!\columnwidth!=\!\hsize!=\!\textwidth!$ and
% $\!\linewidth!=\!\textwidth!-\lrm$ with \!\parshape! to indent lines by
% \!\@totalleftmargin! if $\lrm>0$, to let \mctext{} span across all columns
% reflecting the indentation in the \env{list}-like environments surrounding
% \env{paracol} if any.  We also let $\!\col@number!=1$ to ensure again that
% \!\maketitle!  produces a title without \!\twocolumn! if it is in the
% \mctext.
% 
% Then, after invoking \!\pcol@par! to ensure to be in vertical
% mode, we \!\global!ize \!\@svsechd! and \!\@svsec! which may be defined in
% a lower-level sectioning command such as \!\paragraph! in the \mctext{} so
% that they are properly expanded in \!\everypar! inserted at the beginning
% of the first paragraph of the column to which we switch shortly, even when
% the sectioning command is used inappropriately in the \mctext.
% We also \!\global!ize \!\everypar! by a sequence with three
% \!\expandafter! so that \!\pcol@output@switch! for the \sync{}ed
% \cswitch{} we make shortly broadcasts it to other columns.  Finally after
% closing the group, we let $\!\pcol@nextcol!=d$ and
% $\CSIndex{pcol@sync}=\true$ to set another \sync{}ation point below the
% \mctext{} and to make the captured text combined with \prespan, and then
% invoke \!\pcol@switchcol!  to switch the coloumn $d$.

% 
% The macro \!\pcol@switchcol! is invoked from \!\pcol@switchcolumn!,
% \!\pcol@iswitchcolumn!, \!\pcol@sptext! and \!\endparacol! to switch the
% column $d=\!\pcol@nextcol!$.  First, we save \lcounter{}s in the current
% column $c$ into $\Cc_c$ by \!\pcol@savecounters!.
%
% Next, if $\CSIndex{ifpcol@sync}=\true$, we do the followings.  At first we
% let $\VE={}$\!\pcol@@ensure~vspace! have the natrual component of
% \!\pcol@ensurevspace! which can have a glue specified by \!\ensurevspace!,
% so that it is referred to by \!\pcol@sync! as the minimum space required
% below the \sync{}ation point we are now setting.  Second, we invoke
% \!\pcol@visitallcols! temporarily turning $\CSIndex{ifpcol@sync}=\false$
% for \cscan{}ning to visit all columns but current one to give \TeX's page
% builder the chance to break \colpage{}s in the \tpage{} with \Scfnote{}s
% which could have not been presented in the last visit of the columns.
% Third, we make an \!\output! request with $\!\penalty!=\!\pcol@op@switch!$
% to invoke \!\pcol@output@switch! by \!\pcol@invokeoutput! with
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@sync}=\true$ to make \sync{}ed switch to the column $d$.
% This invocation may result in $\CSIndex{ifpcol@flush}=\true$ to mean the
% \tpage{} should be broken before setting the \sync{}ation point.
% Therefore if so, since \!\pcol@output@switch! switched to the tallest
% column rather than $d$, we put \!\vfil! and \!\penalty!|-10000| to force
% page break, make \cscan{} with \!\newpage! put into each column to have
% some floats in the column in the new \tpage{}, and then invoke
% \!\pcol@output@switch!  again until it returns
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@flush}=\false$ telling us it successfully sets the
% \sync{}ation point switching to the column $d$.  Then as the last operation
% specific to \sync{}ed \cswitch{}, we invoke \!\ensurevspace! with
% \!\baselineskip! to give the default of $\VE$ for the next \sync{}ation.
% 
% Otherwise, i.e., if $\CSIndex{ifpcol@sync}=\false$, we simply make the
% \!\output! request for \!\pcol@output@switch! to switch to the column $d$.
% 
% Then we scan $\Cc_d$ applying \!\pcol@setctrelt! to each
% $\<\cl,\val_d(\cl)\>\in\Cc_d$ to let $\Val(\cl)={\val_d(\cl)}$.  We also
% scan $\T=\!\pcol@aconly!$ applying \!\pcol@aconlyelt! to each
% $\<t_c,c\>\in T$ to inhibit \!\addcontentsline! to the contents file of
% type $t_d$ as specified so by $\!\addcontentsonly!\arg{t_d}\~\arg{d}$.
% Finally, we let $\!\@elt!=\!\relax!$ to make it sure that any lists can be
% manipulated without unexpected application of a macro to their elements.

% The API macros $\!\footnotelayout!\Arg{l}$ is to determine that footnotes
% are \mcfnote{} ($l=|c|$), \scfnote{} without merging ($l=|p|$), or
% \mgfnote{} and \scfnote{} ($l=m$).  The macro examines if
% $l\in\{|c|,|p|,|m|\}$ by the existence of the corresponding macro
% $|\pcol@fnlayout@|{\cdot}l$
% 
% \SpecialArrayIndex{l}{\pcol@fnlayout@}
% 
% and invokes it, or complains if not by \!\PackageError!.
% 
% The macros \!\pcol@fnlayout@c!, \!\pcol@fnlayout@p! and
% \!\pcol@fnlayout@m! turn switches $f_s=\CSIndex{ifpcol@scfnote}$,
% $f_m=\CSIndex{ifpcol@mgfnote}$ and
% $f_a=\CSIndex{ifpcol@fncounteradjustment}$ and make the counter
% \counter{footnote} global or local as follows.
% $$
% \nosv\begin{array}{l|llll}
% l&f_s&f_m&f_a&\counter{footnote}\\\hline

% \end{array}
% $$
% Note that turning \CSIndex{ifpcol@fncounteradjustment} is done by
% \!\fncounteradjustment! ($\true$) or \!\nofncounteradjustment! ($\false$).
% Also note that the setting of |\ifpcol@fncounter|\~|adjustment|
% 
% \SpecialIndex{\ifpcol@fncounteradjustment}
% 
% and the globalization\slash localization of \counter{footnote} are just to
% give defaults and thus can be overridden by API macros giving non-default

% 
% The macro \!\pcol@fntext!\marg{text} is our own version of \LaTeX's
% \!\@footnotetext! used in \!\footnote! and \!\footnotetext! to \!\insert!
% the footnote $\arg{text}$ through \!\footins!.  Since the original and our
% own are made \!\let!-equal by \!\pcol@zparacol!, our own is active
% throughout the environment.  The customization is done to examine if the
% footnote should be deferred and to encapsulate the footnote in a \!\vbox!.
% 
% The deferred footnote insertion is in effect if the footnote typesetting
% is \scfnote{} and \!\footnote! or \!\footnotetext!  appears in a page
% $p<\ptop$.  If so, we put the footnote $\arg{text}$ encapsulated in a
% \!\vbox! by \!\pcol@fntextbody! to the tail of $\df=\!\pcol@topfnotes!$
% with \!\penalty!\!\interlinepenalty! preceding it for the split in
% \!\pcol@deferredfootins!, using \!\pcol@fntextother!\marg{text} whose sole
% user is this macro.  Note that the decision of deferring is done based on
% $p=\!\pcol@page!$ which could be less than that of the page in which the
% footnoted text appears because the paragraph having the text will have a
% page break before the text.  Therefore, $p$ for the footnote can be
% $\ptop$, but this misjudment will not cause problems because the footnote
% will eventually be put in $\ptop$ through $\df$ when the page break
% occurs.
% 
% Otherwise the footnote $\arg{text}$ is processed by
% \!\pcol@fntexttop!\marg{text}, also used solely in this macro, to
% \!\insert! it through \!\footins! as usual but after the encapsulation by
% \!\pcol@fntextbody! and with \!\penalty!\!\interlinepenalty! following it
% to allow \TeX's page builder to split footnotes.
% 
% Note that \!\pcol@fntexttop! and \!\pcol@fntextother! have \!\long!
% property because $\arg{text}$ may have two or more paragraphs.

% \changes{v1.2-2}{2013/05/11}
% 	{Introduced for footnote encapsulation and height capping.}
% 
% The macro \!\pcol@fntextbody!\marg{text}, invoked from \!\pcol@fntexttop!
% and \!\pcol@fntext~other!, encapsulates the footnote $\arg{text}$ in a
% \!\vbox! whose height is $h_{\max}=\!\textheight!-\!\skip!\~\!\footins!$ at
% tallest.  The encapsulation is to inhibit page breaks in a footnote
% because the split by the break will make some skips and other items
% eliminated causing a weird result when split portions are {\em joined}.
% The height capping is thus required to find a page in which the footnote
% resides.
% 
% The macro at first does operations done in \LaTeX's 
% \!\@footnotetext! to put $\arg{text}$ in \!\@tempboxa! but with one
% exception that $\!\hsize!=\!\textwidth!$ rather than \!\columnwidth! when
% \Scfnote{} typesetting is in effect.  Note that this part is blindly copied
% from the original though it should be meaningless to set
% \!\interlinepenalty!, \!\splittopskip!, \!\splitmaxdepth! and
% \!\floatingpenalty! because $\arg{text}$ is encapsulated.
% 
% Then the height-plus-depth of the box is compared with $h_{\max}$ and, if
% it exceeds the limit, the height of the box is set $h_{\max}$, the
% footnote is made followed by a \!\vss! to avoid overfull, and a warning
% message of too tall is put by \!\PackageWarning!.  Finally, the box is put
% into \!\footins! or $\df$ by the invoker of this macro.

% The macro \!\pcol@swapcolumn!$\<c_1\>\<c_2\>\<\Cfrom\>\<\Cto\>$ converts
% the column ordinal $c$ or position $c'$ in the \!\count!

% 
% $c_1$ to the position or ordinal to set it in the \!\count! register
% $c_2$, for a \parapag{}e having columns $c\In\Cfrom\Cto$.  That is, we let
% $c_2=(\Cto-1)-(c_1-\Cfrom)$ if $\CSIndex{ifpcol@swapcolumn}=\true$ to mean
% the \cswap{} is in effect and \!\c@page! is even, while $c_2=c_1$
% otherwise.  We also let $c^g=\!\pcol@colsepid!=c_2-1$ if swapped, or

% \!\c@page! can be different from the ship-out page number to produce a
% weird result if their parities are different, due to page jump.  However

% The macro \!\pcol@icolumncolor!\marg{cmd}\oarg{c}, invoked from
% \!\pcol@columncolor! and \!\normal~columncolor!, performs the operations to
% define the default color of the column $c$ with the coloring command
% $\arg{cmd}\in\{\!\color!\hbox{\oarg{mode}}\ARg{color},\,\!\normalcolor!\}$
% as follows.  First we examine if \!\set@color! is not \!\relax! and we are
% in non-internal vertical or non-restricted horizontal mode and, if not, we
% complain the command whose name is in \!\pcol@colorcommand! is ineffective
% by \!\PackageWarning! and do nothing.  Otherwise and if we are not in a
% \env{paracol} environment, i.e., \!\pcol@zparacol! is not \!\let!-equal to
% \!\pcol@paracol!, or if we are in a column $c'\neq c$, we simply invoke
% \!\pcol@iicolumncolor! to let both $\Celt^c$ and $\Celtshadow^c$ have the
% color $\gamma$ specified by $\arg{cmd}$, because $\Celt^c$ will not be
% referred to by \!\output! routine until a \env{paracol} environment starts
% or \cswitch{} to $c$ is performed.
% 
% Otherwise, i.e., if we are in a \env{paracol} environment and in the
% column $c$, we temporarily let $\cst=\cstshadow$ and
% $\Celt^c=\Celtshadow^c$, the latter is done by \!\pcol@getshadowcc! by a
% lengthy sequence for
% $\!\let!|\pcol@columncolor|{\cdot}c=|\pcol@columncolor@shadow|{\cdot}c$.
% 
% \SpecialArrayIndex{c}{\pcol@columncolor}
% \SpecialArrayIndex{c}{\pcol@columncolor@shadow}
% 
% Then we invoke \!\pcol@clearcolorstack! and \!\pcol@restorecolorstack!
% before and after the operations to define the default color, so that
% $\Celt^c$ is placed at the bottom of the \colorstack{} of |.dvi|.
% 
% The default color definition is done by adding the color $\gamma$ to the
% tail of $\cstb$ by \!\pcol@iicolumncolor!, and by letting
% $\Celtshadow^c=\gamma$ also by \!\pcol@iicolumncolor!, before making the
% \!\output! request \!\pcol@op@cset! for \!\pcol@output@cset! by
% \!\pcol@color@invokeoutput! whose second argument is \!\relax! to mean
% nothing is inserted after \!\vadjust! when we are in horizontal mode.
% Note that the \!\output! request is made outside a group in which we
% rewind and reestablish the \colorstack{} with $\Celtshadow^c$ and
% $\cstshadow$ because the temporary setting $\Celt^c=\Celtshadow^c=\gamma$
% is harmful if it is seen by \!\output!  routine for page breaking which
% can be invoked at the timing of the request of \!\pcol@op@cset! but just
% prior to the acceptance of it.
% 
% The macro $\!\pcol@iicolumncolor!\arg{cmd}\arg{dcs}\arg{scs}$ at first
% invokes $\arg{cmd}$ to let \!\current@color! have the printer-specific color
% information $\gamma$ of $\arg{color}$ or what \!\normalcolor!  specifies,
% temporarily letting \!\set@color! be \!\relax! to let \!\color! or
% \!\normalcolor! just do the \!\def!inition of \!\current@color!  without
% putting coloring \!\special!s nor preparing \colorstack{} popping.  Then
% we \!\xdef!ine $\arg{dcs}$ being $|\pcol@columncolor|{\cdot}c$,
% $|\pcol@columncolor@shadwo|{\cdot}c$ or \!\pcol@colorstack@buf! to have
% $\arg{scs}$ being empty or \!\pcol@colorstack@buf! followed by $\gamma$.
% That is we let $\Celt^c=\gamma$ or $\Celtshadow^c=\gamma$, or add $\gamma$ at

% The macro \!\pcol@reset@color@pop! and its math-mode relative
% $\!\pcol@reset@color@mpop!\Arg{i}\~\Arg{\gamma}$ are invoked by
% \!\aftergroup! mechanism in \!\pcol@set@color@push!, directly for the
% former and through the macro $|\pcol@reset@color@mpop@|{\cdot}i$

% for the latter.  They make \!\output! requests, \!\pcol@op@cpop! in the
% former and $\mppop-i$ in the latter, through \!\pcol@color@invokeoutput!
% whose second argument is \!\relax! because nothing is inserted after
% \!\special! and \!\vadjust! when we are in horizontal or math mode.
% 
% One caution is that \!\pcol@reset@color@pop! can be invoked outside the
% \env{paracol} environment in which the corresponding
% \!\pcol@set@color@push! appears.  In this case with
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@output}=\false$, we don't need to do the pop operation
% and cannot make the \!\output! request for it because \!\output! is not
% for \env{paracol}.  Another remark is that \!\pcol@reset@color@mpop! is
% temporarily redefined by \!\pcol@output@mcpush! to make it
% \!\pcol@output@imcpush! to append $i$ to $\mplist$ and $\gamma$ to $\cst$.

% On the other hand, the counteraprt macro

% 
% Then if $\fdef=\true$, the macro \!\pcol@backgroundcolor@ii! examines if
% $\!\set@color!=\!\relax!$, and if so it complains that any coloring
% packages have not been loaded and invokes \!\pcol@backgroundcolor@w! just
% for throwing away optional arguments for \bgext{} and
% \oarg{mode}\marg{color}.  Otherwise, i.e., if $\!\set@color!\neq\!\relax!$,
% it invokes \!\pcol@backgroundcolor@iii!  after adding $a'$ to the tail of
% \!\pcol@bg@defined!.  On the other hand if $\fdef=\false$, it invokes
% \!\pcol@backgroundcolor@z! without checking the availability of coloring
% macros.
% 
% The macro \!\pcol@backgroundcolor@iii! at first invokes
% $\!\pcol@bg@defext!\Arg{d}\Arg{e}$ with $e=0$ for all
% $d\in\{|l|,|r|,|t|,|b|\}$ to have default (no) \bgext{}s.  Then if

% directly when it finds no coloring packages have not been loaded, or
% \!\pcol@backgroundcolor! and \!\pcol@backgroundcolor@i! through
% \!\pcol@backgroundcolor@e! on error too but in the argument of

% 
% Then \!\pcol@backgroundcolor@wi! throw all arguments away and lets
% $|\pcol@bg@color@|{\cdot}a'\~=\!\relax!$ so that the region $a'$ is
% untouched in \bgpaint{} macros.  Note that since

% 
% The macro \!\endparacol! is invoked from \Endparacol{} to close
% \env{paracol} environment.  After making it sure to be in vertical mode by
% \!\pcol@par!, we switch to the column 0 by \!\pcol@switchcol! to let
% \lcounter{} have the values for the column 0 so that they are referred to
% outside the environment, after saving the current column $c$ in
% \!\pcol@lastcol! to be referred to in \!\pcol@output@end! so that
% $\cc_c(\sw)$ and $\cc_c(\ep)$ are passed to \postenv.
% 
% \begin{Sloppy}{1800}
% Then we invoke \!\pcol@flushclear! for \pfcheck{}, turning
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@lastpage}=\true$ to tell \!\pcol@output@switch! for the
% check that it works on the \lpage, and giving $\bot$ to \!\pcol@flushclear! 
% as its argument, unless footnote typesetting is \scfnote{} but not
% \mgfnote{} for which we give $\df$ to ensure all deferred footnotes are
% put in the checking process.  Note that the argument for \Mcfnote{}
% typesetting is $\df$ but it is definitely $\bot$ in this mode.  After that
% we make an \!\output! request by \!\pcol@invokeoutput! with
% $\!\penalty!=\!\pcol@op@end!$ and still with
% $\CSIndex{ifpcol@lastpage}=\true$ to build the \lpage.
% \end{Sloppy}
% 
% Next, we let $\!\columnwidth!=\!\textwidth!$ and
% $\CSIndex{if@twocolumn}=\false$ for single-column typesetting, and also
% let $\!\topskip!=\!\pcol@topskip!$ to make it sure that the parameter has
% the value used outside in \env{paracol} environment.  Finally, if the
