% This and the next section are typeset with \Uidx{\!\twosided!} enabling
% features |p|, |c| and |m| and also |b| for a part of the next section.
% The effect of |p| feature can be seen by the left side, or in other word
% inside, margin of this odd-numbered page is narrower than that of the
% previous pages because the author reduced the effective left side margin
% being $\!\oddsidemargin!+1\,|in|$ by 75\,\%\footnote{
% 
% This document itself does not have |twoside| option in its
% \!\documentclass! but the inconsistency between the option and
% \!\twosided! is not visible because \!\pagestyle! is |plain|.}.
% 
% This setting makes the right side or outside margin of this page enlarged
% by 125\,\% as well as the left side and outside margin of the next
% even-numbered page.
% 
% Next, we see the effects of |c| and |m| features by the \env{paracol}
% environment below for which \Uidx{\!\columnratio!}|{0.6}| and
% \Uidx{\!\marginparthreshold!}|{0}| are declared to make the \emph{inside}
% columns (left ones in odd-numbered pages) are wider than the
% \emph{outside} ones and all marginal notes go to outside (right in
% odd-numbered pages) margins.

% 
% Now\Marginpar{\it Second marginal note from column-1.} the author puts
% another marginal note whose first line would be aligned to that of this

% \emph{after} that from the column-0 was given, the conflict is solved
% pushing the note from this column down rather than that from the

% \pageref{page:ppts-paired2} and right in the previous page
% \pageref{sec:ppts-paired}, cannot have \pwstuff{} but it is what the
% author can do now for the version 1.3 and thus you have to wait some
% future versions in which the author could devise a mechanism to exploit
% the corresponding space in the pages\footnote{
% 
% You might complain the immaturity of \parapag{}ing and might claim that it
% should be included in \Paracol{} after the author implements the
% mechanism.  In fact the author himself is frustrated current features of
% \parapag{}ing but he dared to release the version 1.3 knowing that there
% are people who happily typeset their \parapag{}ed documents with the
% current limited features.}.
% 
% In addition, you might think it is weird that the |c| feature of
% \!\twosided! swaps columns \emph{and} paired pages.  However this swapping
% is a natural consequence of the combination of \cswap{} and \paired{}
% \parapag{}ing.  Therefore, you can simply disable the |c| feature (maybe
% together with other features) to have more intuitive results.
% 
% In the next Section~\ref{sec:ppts-npaired}, you will see another kind of
% \parapag{}ing namely \npaired{} one.  Before that, we need a blank page to
% let the \npaired{} \parapag{}ing start from an even-numbered page so that
% a left and right page pair comprises a double spread.  A short remark on
% the blank next page is that it does not have a right counterpart
% \parapag{}e because the page is outside \env{paracol} environments and does
% not have any portion from the environments\footnote{
% 
% To illustrate this fact, the author dares to put a real blank page rather
