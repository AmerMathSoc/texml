% \begin{abstract}
% This small file implements some code that was already published on TUGboat,
% but it is adapted to \LaTeX\ and it is enriched with other commands. It helps
% those who create hyphenation patterns, as well normal \LaTeX\ users, to test
% the correctness of the hyphenations of words lists. It works also with
% \prog{xelatex} and \prog{lualatex}.

% \section{Introduction}
%
% This small package introduces the declaration |\testhyphens| and the environment
% |checkhyphens|. The declaration is to be used within a group where the hyphenation
% parameters may be optionally set to any specific value; it processes a list
% of one or more space delimited words typesetting them one per line with hyphens
% between every syllable.
%
% The language, the hyphenation rules of which are to be tested, may be the
% default language before entering the group, or can be a language specified
% with |\selectlanguage| within the group before activating the declaration:
% this declaration could be set within a |\foreignlangeuage|\Arg{language}
% argument or within the body of an |otherlanguage| environment.
%
% The environment |checkhyphens| accepts an optional argument to set the
% hyphenation parameters, and a body consisting of a list
% of one or more space separated words; if the
% user just pastes a text copied from somewhere that included punctuation,
% the punctuation signs are ignored, but are not taken off from the text.
%
% The main code was published long ago by Victor Eijkout, in ``The bag of
% tricks'', \emph{TUGboat} 14.4 (1993), p. 424. He himself states that
% that code was created by Jonathan Kew; Victor Eijkout just added an empty
% |\discretionary{}{}{}|; the idea came to him from  the code created by
% Oliver Schoett that is used for the hyphenation exception list of TUGboat.
% Credit for the code goes completely to the authors mentioned above; I just
% added some sugar to use that code in \LaTeX\ documents for the benefit of
% hyphenation pattern creators, and of regular users who want to know how a
% certain word or the words of a certain sentence would be hyphenated by
% \TeX\ and friends.
%
% Of course this package does not tell the whole truth: in fact \TeX\ and
% friends hyphenate words only when certain conditions are met; these
% conditions are stated in Appendix~H of the \TeX\-book, which is and remains
% the primary reference for understanding the hyphenation process used by
% \TeX\ and friends.

% Sometimes the user complains that certain words are not hyphenated; the user
% might use this package and find out that her/his words are regularly
% hyphenated; then what's happening? Simply those conditions are not met.
% Therefore the full understanding of the above mentioned Appendix~H is
% fundamental before complaining about \TeX\ not working properly with
% hyphenations and possibly before raising a bug notice.
%
% \section{Incompatibility with the previous version 0.5a}
% I had to change some definitions within the body of this package in order
% to avoid clashes mainly with the |french| language option of babel;
% in facts that option declares most punctuation marls as active characters.
% Unfortunately those characters receive global definitions, therefore they
% remain active even when they should not perform any action. 
%
% It is necessary to emphasize that the previous version used the colon as
% a parameter separator; while, in order to avoid conflicts with |french|,
% the parameter separator is a simple hyphen.
%
% Defining active characters when using |polyglossia| may produce other
% incompatibilities that are easily circumvented by specifying languages
% in a different order. In facts, if you specify languages as such
%\begin{verbatim}
%\setmainlanguage[babelshorthands]{italian}
%\setotherlanguages{english,french}
%\end{verbatim}
% produces an error when |french| sets up its parameters for the UNICODE
% apostrophe: the cause of this error derives from the use of the |italian| option
% |babelshorthands|; of course if this option is not specified, no problems
% arise. But if you interchange the declarations as in
%\begin{verbatim}
%\setotherlanguages{english,french}
%\setmainlanguage[babelshorthands]{italian}
%\end{verbatim}
% no problems arise.
%
% \section{Usage}
% This package has been tested with |pdflatex|, |xelatex|, and |lualatex|; 
% for |lualatex| a package |showhyphens| exists that marks the hyphen
% points of an entire document with thin red vertical strokes at the
% possible break points. The user may use the package s/he prefers by
% taking into consideration her/his needs with respect with the features
% and the functionalities of package |testhyphens| compared to those
% of |showhyphens|.
%
% Remember that normal  Plain \TeX\ and \LaTeX\ have available the command
% |\showhyphens| but, differently from this package, such command works
% only when the typesetting engine is |tex| or |pdftex|; moreover the result
% appears on the console window and in the \texttt{.log} file and no written
% record remains available to the user; for |xelatex| there was a workaround
% provided by another package, but for some reasons it did not work in every
% circumstance.  This package |testhyphens|, on the opposite, prints the result
% in the output document and works also with |xetex| as the typesetting engine.
%
% This simple package  is loaded just with the usual statement 
% \begin{flushleft}
%|\usepackage{testhyphens}|
% \end{flushleft}
% 
% The package defines for the end user one declaration |\testhyphens| and
% one environment |checkhyphens| the syntax of which is the following:
%\begin{sintassi}
% |\begin{checkhyphens}|\oarg{hyphenation parameters}
% \marg{word list}
% |\end{checkhyphens}|
%\end{sintassi}
% where \meta{hyphenation parameters} is a \emph{hyphen separated list} of two 
% digits that in order will be assigned by the environment respectively to
% |\lefthyphenmin| and |\righthyphenmin|; \meta{word list} is self
% explanatory. Nevertheless it good to remember that the environment isolates
% single words by using a space as a word separator; this requires that the
% list is preceded and followed by spaces; setting the environment with the
% opening and closing statements on single lines, as shown above, is sufficient,
% while a source line such as
% |\begin{checkhyphens}|\oarg{hyphenation parameters}\marg{word list}|\end{checkhyphens}|
% might not produce the desired result.
%
% \section[Hyphenation parameters]{Using hyphenation parameters}
% The hyphenation parameters are just |\lefthyphenmin| and |\righthyphenmin|;
% they represent the minimum number of characters that the first and, respectively,
% the last word fragment must have before or until hyphenation takes place;
% for example in English the default values are 2 and~3; in Italian the default
% values are 2 and~2; in Greek the default values are 1 and~1.
%
% Let us make an example: the word \emph{idea} is spelt the same in English and
% Italian, although it is pronounced differently; but in both cases the word is
% not hyphenated at all in both languages. According to the Italian hyphenation
% rules its grammatical hyphenation is \emph{i-de-a}; possibly in English the
% grammatical hyphenation is the same; in any case the initial and the terminal
% syllables are too short to comply with the above mentioned \TeX\ hyphenation
% parameters, and \TeX\ refrains from hyphenating this word. In Greek, on the
% opposite, \foreignlanguage{greek}{ιδέα}  is divided into
% \foreignlanguage{greek}{ι-δέ-α}.
%
% If you use |checkhyphens| with the optional hyphenation parameters specified to
% 1 and~1 in Italian or in English, as in
%\begin{verbatim}
%\begin{checkhyphens}[1-1] 
%idea
%\end{checkhyphens}
%\end{verbatim}
% you don't get any useful result in English, and the word remains un-hyphenated;
% but in Italian is turns out to be \emph{i-de-a} as in Greek. 
%
% This happens because the Italian patterns were created by hand and tested with
% parameters 1 and~1, even if for typesetting purposes the parameters are set
% to 2 and~2. In English the patterns were created by means of the program
% \prog{patgen} where parameters 2 and~3 were set. Typographically speaking
% the values 1 and~1 for Italian are almost useless, but in certain difficult
% narrow-measure texts the user has the possibility to locally set the first
% and/or the second parameter to 1, and solve that particular instance of
% problematic narrow-measure typesetting.
%
% \section{Examples}
% Here we show some actual examples using either the declaration or the environment.
% While typesetting in English we might verify the hyphenation of some words.
% We set in the source file the following lines (notice the |\par| command is a reminder that the group containing the declaration must be used in vertical mode; a blank line would be equivalent):
%\begin{verbatim}
%\par
%{\testhyphens 
%manifests instruments 
%he analyses the samples and submits the analyses to the federal office 
%}
%\end{verbatim}
% The result produced by this package, typeset within a four-column multicols environment, is:
%
%\begin{multicols}{4}{\testhyphens 
%manifests instruments 
%he analyses the samples and submits the analyses to the federal office 
%}\end{multicols}
% Notice the two instances of the word |analyses|; \TeX\ hyphenates them the
% same way in English, but one of the two is hyphenated in a wrong way;
% unfortunately there is no way for \TeX\ to distinguish homographic words
% that are not homophonic ones. In plain terms the verb ``analyses'' is stressed
% on the `y', while the noun ``analyses'' is stressed on the second `a';
% the standard phonetic hyphenation rules for English probably should hyphenate
% the verb as ``an-a-lyses'', but \TeX\ works only on the spelling and not on
% the sound and does not make any logical analysis of the text to find out
% if a word plays the rôle of a noun or of a verb. In this and similar
% situations (for example: ``the record'' and ``to record'') the user should
% check a good reliable dictionary and possibly  use an explicit discretionary
% hyphen~|\-|.
%
% While typesetting in Italian it is possible to insert in the source file
% a set of lines such as these:
%\begin{verbatim}
%\begin{checkhyphens}
%ebbe la bell'idea di viaggiare in scooter
%\end{checkhyphens}
%\end{verbatim}
% that produces the following result:
%\begin{multicols}{4}
%\begin{otherlanguage*}{italian}
%\begin{checkhyphens}
%ebbe la bell'idea di viaggiare in scooter
%\end{checkhyphens}
%\end{otherlanguage*}\end{multicols}
%Notice that ``idea'' cannot be hyphenated by \TeX\ when it is an isolated
% word; but in Italian the apostrophe is used (also) to mark a vocalic elision,
% therefore for hyphenation purposes, even if it is not a letter, it is assigned
% a lowercase code, and it legally becomes part of a word, in our case the word
% ``bell'idea''. Therefore the patterns that involve the apostrophe produce
% the result shown above, where the first grammatical hyphen point shows up again.
%
% While typesetting in Greek we might insert in the source file the following code:
%\begin{flushleft}\ttfamily\obeylines
%|\begin{checkhyphens}|
%\begin{otherlanguage*}{greek}
%επεξεργάζεται αρχεία τα οποία περιέχουν τουσ χαρακτήρες που
% υπάρχουν στο πληκτρολόγιο του υπολογιστή σας
%\end{otherlanguage*}
%|\end{checkhyphens}|
%\end{flushleft}
%and we would get:
%\begin{multicols}{4}
%\begin{otherlanguage*}{greek}
%\begin{checkhyphens}
%επεξεργάζεται αρχεία τα οποία περιέχουν τουσ χαρακτήρες που υπάρχουν 
%στο πληκτρολόγιο του υπολογιστή σας
%\end{checkhyphens}
%\end{otherlanguage*}\end{multicols}
%\noindent while, had we set the hyphenation parameters different from the default
% values 1 and~1, as in: 
%\begin{flushleft}\ttfamily\obeylines
%|\begin{checkhyphens}[2-2]|
%\begin{otherlanguage*}{greek}
%επεξεργάζεται αρχεία τα οποία περιέχουν τουσ χαρακτήρες που 
%υπάρχουν στο πληκτρολόγιο του υπολογιστή σας
%\end{otherlanguage*}
%|\end{checkhyphens}|
%\end{flushleft}
%the result would be:
%\begin{multicols}{4}
%\begin{otherlanguage*}{greek}
%\begin{checkhyphens}[2-2]
%επεξεργάζεται αρχεία τα οποία περιέχουν τουσ χαρακτήρες που υπάρχουν 
%στο πληκτρολόγιο του υπολογιστή σας
%\end{checkhyphens}
%\end{otherlanguage*}\end{multicols}
%
% Notice that as things are at the moment of writing this documentations,
% the monotonic Greek hyphenation patterns fail to hyphenate after an
% accented vowel followed by a consonant\footnote{My PDF file of this
% documentations does not exhibit this feature, because I have available the
% correct hyphenations patterns for the three Greek orthographic spellings, but
% these are not yet officially available to the \TeX\ community because the Greek
% maintainers have not yet finished testing them. You might be reading a
% re-typeset version of this documentation, and this feature might be present.};
% the grammar allows to hyphenate in that position; in any case the patterns
% correctly recognise the hiatus between an accented vowel and an unaccented one.
% The first Greek example shows very clearly the effect of |\lefthyphenmin=1|
% compared to the second example where |\lefthyphenmin=2|. On the other hand,
% the fact that some hyphen points are missing is certainly a feature that
% precludes full hyphenation, but it does not produce hyphenation errors.
%
% For the user information it was the very use of this package that highlighted
% the features/bugs in the Greek hyphenation patterns; at the moment of writing
% this documentation, work is in progress for testing new hyphen sets. Notice
% that this behaviour is present when typesetting with  |pdflatex| and |babel|,
% while these features are absent when  |xelatex| or |lualatex| are used with
% |polyglossia|.

% \section{The code}
%\iffalse
%<*package>
%\fi
% The following code has very few modifications compared to the original code
% published by Victor Eijkout. For my own benefit I changed the declaration
% name from |\printhyphens| to |\t@sthyphens|; with an  at-sign internal name
% it is less likely that  the declaration is redefined by a user. I also moved
% the command |\offinterlineskip| from its penultimate position in the original
% code to the first command to be executed within the |\vbox|; in this way
% I avoided certain cases in which the lack of interline skip would remain
% active after closing the environment.
%
% The code is based on treating the interword space as an active character
% that plays different rôles according to its position; it lets the
% declaration isolate the words to be hyphenated and open suitable boxes,
% that are closed at the moment of processing the following word; the
% |\everypar| token-list distinguishes the various actions to be performed
% at each step.
%
% But the trick is to set each word within a vertical box where the measure
% (the text width |\hsize|) is zero; in this way each word is hyphenated at
% the first hyphen point, but the word fragment that remains in the following
% line is still too long and gets hyphenated again; the process is repeated
% again and again until the initial string is exhausted. The contents of the
% |\vbox|, that now contains the syllables one per line, is reassembled to
% form one line, and this line is output within an |\hbox| and is therefore
% the box typeset in vertical mode; this is why the declaration must be issued
% in vertical mode, so as to start processing the word list with the right
% foot; this is also why the word list must start and end with  spaces; the
% first one before the first word opens the first box, and the last space after
% the last word closes and outputs the last box.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\t@sthyphens{\everypar{\setbox0\lastbox \setbox1\hbox{\strut}\vbox\bgroup
\offinterlineskip
\everypar{\setbox0\lastbox \nobreak\hskip\z@}\dimen0=\hsize
\hsize=\z@ \hfuzz\maxdimen \def\par{\endgraf \hsize=\dimen0\getlastline
\egroup\endgraf}}\breakafterword}

\def\breakafterword{\catcode`\^^M\active\catcode`\ \active}

{\breakafterword\gdef^^M{\par}\global\let ^^M}

\def\getlastline{\setbox0\lastbox\ifvoid0\let\next\nomorelines

\unhbox1}\let\next\getlastline\fi\next}

\def\nomorelines{\unhbox1}
%    \end{macrocode}
% The above code is substantially the original one; now we define the user
% declaration control sequence |\testhyphens| by letting it to assume the
% meaning of the internal control sequence. Then we define the |checkhyphens|
% environment where  we make sure that the whole process of the word list
% contained in its body takes place in vertical mode. In oder to process
% the optional argument for setting the hyphenation parameters, we define
% a delimited argument macro |\s@thyphenpars| that uses the \emph{hyphen} as
% argument delimiter.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\let\testhyphens\t@sthyphens
