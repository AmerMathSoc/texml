%    The alignment file examples as well as the topology data file are 
%    needed for \TeX ing this documentation
%    and can serve as illustrations for the |MSF| and |ALN| 
%    file format.
%    
%    The following subsections give an overview of the capabilities of
%    the \TeXtopo{} package. All commands are described in detail 
%    later on.
%    
%    \subsection{Version History}
%    
%    \textbf{v1.5 2011/06/02}
%    \medskip
%    
%    Compatibility with the current \TeXshade{} version was
%    re-established. 
%    \medskip
%    
%    \textbf{v1.4 2005/02/14}
%    \medskip
%    
%    A new topology input format has been implemented: HMMTOP, see 
%    \ref{HMMTOP}.
%    A rotation issue with classical flat helical wheels has been addressed 
%    and some minor bugs have been fixed.
%    \bigskip
%    
%    \newpage
%    
%    \textbf{v1.3 2002/04/15}
%    \medskip
%    
%    The unnecessary restriction to the DVIPS
%    driver for |color.sty| has been removed\footnote{As suggested by
%    Eckhart Guth\"ohrlein.}. Any color.sty compatible
%    driver option can be given with the |\usepackage{textopo}| call
%    and is then passed to the |color| package. Further, 
%    |rotating.sty| is no longer needed. The maximal helix length has
%    been increased to 36\,aa.
%    Introduction of two new helical wheel styles (|net| and |wheel|) 
%    and the display of the hydrophobic moment. Corresponding commands:
%    |\helixstyle|, |\showmoment|, |\hidemoment|, |\momentcolor|, 
%    |\scalemoment|, |\Hmean|, |\muH|, |\muHmean|, |\mudelta|).
%    
%    
%    \bigskip
%    
%    \textbf{v1.2 2001/03/09}
%    \medskip
%    
%    Several new commands were introduced: |\movelegend| for a free
%    re-location of the figure legend, |\footloop| adds a foot to
%    a specified loop and thus keeps the distance between the transmembrane
%    domains small, |\broadenmembrane| and |\thickenmembrane| allow 
%    one to change the dimensions of the membrane. In the helicalwheel
%    environment number series can be written with a dash, e.\,g. |{1-5}|
%    instead of |{1,2,3,4,5}|. In commands that move labels the new
%    position can be given in \emph{x}/\emph{y}-values besides
%    the \meta{direction} and \meta{distance} parameters.
%    \bigskip
%    
%    
%    \textbf{v1.1 2000/07/12}
%    \medskip
%    
%    One major improvement was achieved by changing the handedness of
%    the transmembrane helices to be consistently left-handed. 
%    See the cover figure! The
%    documentation now contains instructions where to find basic
%    \LaTeX{} documents and how to increase \TeX's
%    parameter settings.
%    \bigskip
%    
%    
%    \textbf{v1.0a 2000/05/16 -- v1.0c 2000/06/03}
%    \medskip
%    
%    Minor corrections of the documentation and bug fixes in the
%    |\place|, |\addtagtoNterm| and |\addtagtoCterm| commands.
%    Improvement of the \TeX{}shade compatibility.

%    \subsection{\LaTeX{} basics}
%    
%    \subsubsection{Typesetting documents with \LaTeX}
%    
%    In order to use any of the macros provided by the \BioTeX-project 
%    (see \ref{appshad}) efficiently a basic understanding of the \TeX{} 
%    typesetting system and its usage is required. Several books are
%    available on this topic, but a rather quick and easy introduction
%    is the \emph{Not so short introduction to \LaTeX}. This document
%    is available from all Comprehensive \TeX{} Archive Network 
%    (CTAN) servers,
%    e.\,g. from \texttt{ftp://ftp.dante.de/pub/tex/documentation/lshort/},
%    in many different languages and formats besides \LaTeX{}, such 
%    as PostScript and on-line viewable PDF.
%    I also put a link from the \BioTeX{} (\TeXshade/\TeXtopo) homepage 
%    to the document collection
%    (\texttt{http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/beitz/biotex.html}).
%    
%    
%    \subsubsection{Memory shortness when using \TeXtopo}
%    
%    If you are using \TeXtopo{} to plot topologies of larger proteins 
%    ($> 600$ residues), LaTeX will probably stop compiling and quit with one
%    of the following messages: 
%    \texttt{!\ TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [main memory size=384000]} or 
%    \texttt{!\ TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [stack size=300]}.
%    
%    \TeX{} allocates space for different kinds of internal variables. 
%    Plotting topologies of big membrane proteins needs lots of memory,
%    usually more than for typesetting plain text.
%    Thus, the parameter settings of a standard \TeX{} installation might not
%    be sufficient for certain plotting projects. This becomes obvious
%    when \TeX{} complains about insufficient memory by displaying error 
%    messages and the setting process is interrupted. There is no reason to be 
%    concerned. The parameters can be set by hand. Unfortunately, 
%    each \TeX{} system hides its default parameter file in a different
%    place in the system. 
%    
%    In the following, an excerpt from a FAQ-list to \TeXshade, an 
%    alignment setting macro for \LaTeX{}, is added. This explains how 
%    to increase the settings in Oz\TeX{} for the Macintosh, Mik\TeX{} 
%    for Windows and te\TeX{} for *NIX \TeX{} distributions. Please contribute 
%    to this list!
%    
%    \begin{enumerate}
%    
%    \item
%    
%    \textbf{Oz\TeX{} 4.0 for the Macintosh:}
%    
%    Find the file `OzTeX:TeX:Configs:Default'. This file contains
%    all memory settings. Look for the section 
%    `\% TeX parameters' and increase the values that \TeX{} complains
%    about during the run. You will have to restart Oz\TeX{} before the
%    changes are active.
%    
%    For older versions of Oz\TeX{} the configuration file has the 
%    same name but the path is somewhat different.
%    
%    
%    \item
%    
%    \textbf{te\TeX{} for *NIX:} (contributed by Joerg Daehn)
%    
%    Find the file: `/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf' or
%    use |locate texmf.cnf| at the command prompt to find it.
%
%    Login as super user. Backup `texmf.cnf' in case you destroy something and
%    then open the `texmf.cnf' file in your favorite text editor and use its
%    search function to locate |main_memory|. This variable is set to 384000.
%    Change this to some higher value, i.e. 4000000 (works fine for me!). The
%    total amount of memory should not exceed 8000000, so check the other
%    values in that section. 
%
%    Next, you want to change the stack size. Search for |stack_size|. This
%    will be set to 300. I changed it to 4000 and it works fine.
%
%    There might be complains by \TeX{} about further specific parameters such
%    as \verb|stack_size|. You find all those in the same file.
%
%    After this you have to run `texconfig init'.
%
%    Logout as root.
%
%    After this all should be set for large plots. Happy \TeX{}ing!
%
%    The information on how to achieve this was derived from a mail in the
%    te\TeX{} mail archive. The original question was posted by Pascal Francq and
%    answered by Rolf Nieprasch.
%
%    
%    \item
%    
%    \textbf{MiK\TeX{} for Windows:}
%    
%    The MiK\TeX{} documentation describes very detailed how the memory
%    settings can be changed. In brief, you must locate the 
%    configuration file `miktex/config/miktex.ini'. In the [MiKTeX] 
%    section of this file you find all the parameters you need, e.\,g.\ 
%    \verb|mem_min|, \verb|mem_max|, \verb|buf_size|, \verb|stack_size| etc.
%    
%    It appears, that the standard settings of MiK\TeX{} are bigger 
%    than that of other \TeX{} installations, so it may not always be necessary 
%    to increase the values.
%    
%    
%    \end{enumerate}
%
%    
%    \subsection{System requirements}
%
%    \TeXtopo{} requires at least \LaTeXe{} and \texttt{color.sty}.  
%    David Carlisle's \texttt{color.sty} is part of the Standard \LaTeX{}
%    `Graphics Bundle' [1]. This package can be downloaded from any
%    \TeX{} archive, e.g.\ \texttt{ftp.dante.de}; usually it is already 
%    included in a comprehensive \TeX{} installation. 
%    
%    The |color| style allows one to use several |[|\meta{options}|]|, e.\,g.
%    |dvips|, |pdftex| or |dviwin|. These provide the commands which
%    different devices/programs need to display colored output. It is 
%    advisable to make yourself familiar with the |color.sty| manual. 
%    You should define a default driver in the file |color.cfg|.
%    Since there is no direct call of |color.sty| by the user, the 
%    option can be stated when \TeXtopo{} is loaded, see next 
%    subsection. If no option is stated the |DVIPS| driver will be 
%    loaded as was default before.
%    
%    With the |[dvips]| option for example the output DVI-file 
%    can be converted to \textsc{PostScript} using the |DVIPS| program
%    and can later be viewed or printed with the public domain 
%    |Ghostview| program which is
%    available for almost all computer platforms. Further, more and more
%    standard \TeX{} viewers are to a certain extent \textsc{PostScript} compatible, 
%    e.\,g.\ Oz\TeX{} on the Macintosh. The option |pdftex| makes the 
%    conversion to a PDF file easy etc.
%    
%    \TeXtopo{} is compatible with \TeXshade{} (version 1.3 or newer) which
%    is a mighty alignment shading package for \LaTeXe{}. In combination with 
%    \TeXshade{} the capability of \TeXtopo{} is greatly enhanced, 
%    e.\,g.\ by the automatic application of calculated shading from 
%    protein alignments or shading due to functional properties, such
%    as charge or accessible side chain area, see \ref{ts}.
%    
%    \bigskip
%    
%    
%    
%    \subsection{\TeXtopo{}'s environments}
%    \label{tsenvironment}
%    
%    In order to make \TeXtopo{} available for your document declare
%    it in the document header section:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad |\usepackage[|\meta{option}|]{textopo}|
%    
%    \medskip
%    Make sure that the file `|textopo.sty|' is present in a directory
%    searched by \TeX{} (see the installation notes in the file
%    `|textopo.txt|'). 
%    
%    The \meta{option} given here is passed to |color.sty| which 
%    handles the color commands for a particular output device, see 
%    previous subsection and the |color.sty| manual.
%    
%    The package provides two new environments, i.\,e.\ the |textopo| 
%    and the |helicalwheel| environment. Both are described in 
%    greater detail below. 
%    
%    \subsubsection{The \texttt{textopo} environment}
%    \label{topoenv}
%    
%    This environment displays schematic topology plots of membrane proteins. 
%    \TeXtopo{} can import sequence and 
%    topology data directly from PHD or HMMTOP predictions, SwissProt 
%    database files
%    (see the example files |AQP1.PHD|, |AQP1.hmm| and |V2.SP| for their 
%    structure) or alignment files (MSF and ALN format; example files
%    are also provided). When SwissProt files are used \TeXtopo{} will
%    automatically extract all the information about special domains,
%    variations, mutations etc.\ from the database file and label
%    the respective positions in the plot.
%    Alternatively, one can manually enter the sequence and the positions 
%    of the membrane spanning domains within the environment. Based on
%    this data \TeXtopo{} produces a first plot. Then, the
%    output can be further adjusted to one's needs by adding labels, special 
%    styles for the appearance of the residues, shading (automatic 
%    [see÷\ref{ts}] or manual) and legends.
%    \medskip
%    
%    The usage of the |textopo| environment is easy:
%    
%    \vbox{%
%    \begin{quote}
%    |\begin{textopo}[|\meta{optional parameterfile}|]|
%         
%    \quad\emph{further \emph{\TeXtopo} commands}
%    
%    |\end{textopo}|
%    \end{quote}}
%    
%    In the optional parameter file (section~\ref{paramfilestruc})
%    any \TeXtopo{} command can be given in order to fix user
%    specific settings. This option provides fast and consistent outputs.
%    At least one command is necessary whithin the environment which
%    loads the sequence and topology of the protein to be plotted, 
%    i.\,e.\ |\getsequence| [\ref{mgetsequence}] or |\sequence| + |\MRs| 
%    [\ref{msequence},\ref{mMRs}].
%    
%    
%    \subsubsection{The \texttt{helicalwheel} environment}
%    \label{wheelenv}
%    
%    This second environment provides essentially the same 
%    functionality as |textopo|. Here, the output 
%    depicts the helical transmembrane spans as helical wheels 
%    (perspective or flat) or as helical nets which is basically 
%    the same kind of display as in the topology plots.
%    One can choose all or a subset of transmembrane domains and set any desired
%    order. Views from the outside onto the cell membrane or vice versa
%    are possible.
%    \medskip
%    
%    The usage is as easy as this:
%    
%    \vbox{%
%    \begin{quote}
%    |\begin{helicalwheel}[|\meta{parameterfile}|]{|\meta{helixlist}|}|
%         
%    \quad\emph{further \emph{\TeXtopo} commands}
%    
%    |\end{helicalwheel}|
%    \end{quote}}
%    
%    The optional parameter file can be used as described above. 
%    A list of the helices which are to be displayed is mandatory, i.\,e.
%    |{1,2,3,4,5,6}|; or for displaying a subset with changed order: 
%    |{1,3,2,5}|. Series of numbers can be typed with a dash, e.\,g.
%    |{1-3,9,5-7}|. Further, each helix number can be followed by
%    an optional parameter which indicates an angle by which the
%    transmembrane domain is rotated (only integer values). If a 
%    series of helix numbers are to be rotated by the same angle
%    use the following scheme: |{1-3[90],4-6,7[135]}|.
%    
%    A basic example shows helices 1 and 4 of an aquaporin and
%    rotates helix no.÷4 by 50$^\circ$ 
%    (Fig.÷\ref{figwheel}):
%    
%    \begin{figure}
%    \begin{helicalwheel}{1,4[50]}
%       \getsequence{PHD}{AQP1.PHD}
%    \end{helicalwheel}
%    \caption{A basic helical wheel example.}\label{figwheel}
%    \end{figure}
%    
%    \vbox{%
%    \begin{quote}
%    |\begin{helicalwheel}{1,4[50]}|
%    
%    \quad|\getsequence{PHD}{AQP1.PHD}|
%    
%    |\end{helicalwheel}|
%    \end{quote}}
%    
%    
%    \subsection{\TeX{}shade (v1.3 and up) compatibility}
%    \label{ts}
%    
%    \TeXshade{} is a very comprehensive \LaTeXe{} package for
%    displaying and shading protein and nucleotide alignments [2].
%    Package and documentation are available from the same
%    source as the \TeXtopo{} package, i.\,e.\ any CTAN site, 
%    e.\,g.\ |ftp.dante.de|, or from the \TeXshade{} homepage 
%    |http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/beitz/tse.html|.
%    
%    Since version 1.3 \TeXshade{} provides its full functionality for 
%    \TeXtopo{}, i.\,e.\ protein topology plots can be shaded 
%    automatically due to functional properties of the amino acid
%    residues or to sequence conservation based on protein
%    alignments. Most of the more than 100 \TeXshade{} commands are
%    applicable in addition to the commands provided by \TeXtopo{}
%    to customize the output or to define new shading modes.
%    
%    A simple example is shown in Fig.÷\ref{figshad}. It loads the sequence and 
%    topology data from a |PHD| file and applies shading calculated from
%    an alignment in the |MSF| format.
%    
%    \vbox{%
%    \begin{quote} \label{tsexample}

%    \end{textopo}
%    \caption{Topology plot with shading calculated
%     on the basis of a protein alignment.}\label{figshad}
%    \end{figure}
%    \bigskip
%    
%    Shading can also be applied to helical wheels as shown in 
%    Fig.÷\ref{figwheelshad}: 
%    
%    \vbox{%
%    \begin{quote}
%    |\begin{helicalwheel}{1-4}|

%    \begin{helicalwheel}{1-4}
%       \getsequence{PHD}{AQP1.PHD}
%       \applyshading{functional}{chemical}
%    \end{helicalwheel}
%    \caption{Some helical wheels with `chemical'
%    shading.}\label{figwheelshad}
%    \end{figure}
%    
%    \subsection{Customization of the output}
%    
%    The previously shown basic outputs may not be satisfactory enough
%    in terms of flexibility, additional shading, or application of 
%    labels. Therefore \TeXtopo{} provides commands which enable the
%    user to modify and refine the plot in many ways.
%    
%    Special domains in the protein sequence can be highlighted by the
%    use of shading colors or of squares and diamonds representing the
%    residues instead of circles. These additions will be automatically
%    included in the legend. Labels can be attached to single
%    residues or stretches. Secondary modifications, such as phosphorylation 
%    and glycosylation, may be shown as an encircled `P' and a tree, 
%    respectively. The appearance of the membrane is adjustable.
%    
%    Further, the display of the structure itself can be altered by
%    setting values for the maximal extension of each loop, by 
%    defining so-called `half-loops' which are invaginations of short
%    lipophilic stretches into the membrane or by declaring membrane
%    anchors, such as GPI-anchors or bound lipids. One can change
%    the location of the N-terminus from intra- to extracellular and
%    vice versa.
%    
%    The description of the usage of all necessary commands is topic of the
%    following sections.
%    
%    \section{Use of a \TeXtopo{} parameter file
%             \label{paramfilestruc}}
%    Using predefined parameter files for repeatedly occuring situations
%    can save a lot of typing and makes the output throughout the 
%    publication or presentation more consistent. Further, such
%    files are an easy way to exchange self-defined shading 
%    modes or new color schemes (i.\,e.\ for a satisfying grayscale output) 
%    with other users. If you have created a
%    parameter file, which you think is of interest for others, please 
%    submit it to me\footnote{|eric.beitz@uni-tuebingen.de|} as an e-mail 
%    attachment together with a short 
%    description. I will take care of those files and post them---with 
%    a reference to the author---together with the next \TeXtopo{} 
%    distribution to make them available for all interested users.
%    
%    No special file format is required for parameter 
%    files. \TeXtopo{} simply calls the file using the |\input|
%    command right after resetting all parameters to default. An
%    example parameter file is present containing the standard
%    parameters of \TeXtopo{} called |textopo.def|. This file can be
%    changed freely and can be used as a template for the creation of
%    personal parameter files. 
%    
%    
%    \section{\TeXtopo{} user commands}
%    
%    The \TeXtopo{} package must be loaded by the |\usepackage|
%    command in the document header section.
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\usepackage[|\meta{option}|]{textopo}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    Then, the |textopo| and |helicalwheel| environments are ready to use 
%    as described in \ref{tsenvironment}. See also section \ref{paramfilestruc} 
%    for a description of the optional parameter file. All other 
%    commands provided by \TeXtopo{} must be used within the
%    |textopo|/|helicalwheel| environments. The following sections
%    mainly focus on plotting topologies rather than helical wheels.
%    For the latter a special section is reserved [\ref{helwheel}]. Nevertheless,
%    almost all commands behave the same in both environments.
%    
%    The \TeXtopo{} command syntax mainly follows the \LaTeX{} conventions. 
%    Mandatory parameters are indicated by braces (|{}|), optional
%    parameters are set in brackets (|[]|). Sometimes, optional
%    parameters can be included in mandatory parameter definitions
%    in order to save a lot of additional commands:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad |\command[|\meta{general option}|]{|\meta{mandatory}|[|\meta{optional}|]}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    This syntax is not used in standard \LaTeX{} commands. The
%    following descriptions explain exactly in which commands this
%    new kind of declaration can be used.
%    
%    
%    \subsection{Sequence and topology data sources}
%    
%    As pointed out earlier, there are several sources of data which can
%    be accessed by \TeXtopo: (a) PHD topology predictions [3], (b) 
%    HMMTOP topology prdictions [8], (c) SwissProt database files, (d) 
%    alignment files in the MSF- 
%    (GCG PileUp) or ALN- (Clustal) format and (e) manually provided
%    sequences. The latter two sources do not contain topological data, 
%    therefore the location of the transmembrane domains must be 
%    entered by hand using |\MRs| [\ref{align}] and the location of
%    the N-terminus must be set by |\Nterm| [\ref{mNterm}]. Let us go 
%    through all options:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \subsubsection{PHD files} 
%    \label{PHD}
%    
%    The sequence together with the topology
%    is presented near the bottom of the file (see example |AQP1.phd|).
%    \TeXtopo{} analyzes the lines starting out with |AA| which contain
%    the amino acid sequence and those beginning with |PHDThtm| to 
%    obtain the topology prediction. This information is converted
%    into \TeXtopo{} commands which are subsequently stored in a file
%    named \textit{filename}|.tpo|. This has the advantage 
%    that the entries are editable for further \TeX{} runs.
%    \TeXtopo{} will not overwrite existing |tpo|-files in order
%    to keep user made modifications of these files, but it can
%    be forced to overwrite them by using the optional parameter
%    |[make new]|.
%    \medskip
%    
%    Syntax: |\getsequence[make new]{PHD}{|\meta{PHD-file}|}| \label{mgetsequence}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \subsubsection{HMMTOP files} 
%    \label{HMMTOP}
%    
%    HMMTOP predictions have various possibilities for the output
%    format. Choose the extended format in TEXT-mode, because 
%    this contains the sequence in addition to the position of the 
%    termini and transmembrane domains (see example |AQP1.hmm|).
%    This information is in analogy to PHD-files, s.\,a., converted
%    into \TeXtopo{} commands which are subsequently stored in a file
%    named \textit{filename}|.htp|.
%    \medskip
%    
%    Syntax: |\getsequence[make new]{HMMTOP}{|\meta{HMMTOP-file}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    
%    \subsubsection{SwissProt files} 
%    \label{SwissProt}
%    
%    These files provide next to the
%    amino acid sequence (at the very bottom, |SQ|) much more information. 
%    Have a look at the example file |AQP1.SP|. The lines starting out with
%    |FT| contain data about sequence features. Here, the positions 
%    of the transmembrane domains (|TRANSMEM|) are listed. All additional 
%    features will automatically be displayed in the topology plot as shaded 
%    sequence stretches or as labels. Unfortunately, the locations of 
%    the transmembrane domains are not always listed. In this case \TeXtopo{} 
%    will complain about missing definitions of membrane regions and those
%    have to be entered by hand, see \ref{align}. As in \ref{PHD} a new file
%    is written by \TeXtopo{} with a name like this: \textit{filename}|.swp| to 
%    enable easy customization.
%    \medskip
%    
%    Syntax: |\getsequence[make new]{SwissProt}{|\meta{SwissProt-file}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    
%    \subsubsection{Alignment files} 
%    \label{align}
%    
%    In order to extract a sequence
%    from an alignment file the respective sequence number has to be
%    stated based on the top sequence which is defined as no.÷1; if no
%    number is indicated \TeXtopo{} loads the first sequence. Two different
%    alignment file formats are readable by \TeXtopo, see the examples
%    |AQPpro.MSF| and |AQP2spec.ALN|. 
%    \medskip
%    
%    Syntax: |\getsequence[|\meta{seqnum}|]{alignment}{|\meta{Alignment-file}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    The positions of the membrane regions are declared by the command
%    |\MRs{|\meta{start1..stop1,start2..stop2,\ldots,start n..stop n}|}|. 
%    \label{mMRs} If the \emph{\underline{M}}embrane 
%    \emph{\underline{R}}egion\emph{\underline{s}} are located for example 
%    from position
%    88 to 109 and from 123 to 150 enter |\MRs{88..109,123..150}|. 
%    Due to the thickness of the lipid bilayer an 
%    $\alpha$-helical transmembrane spanning region is about 21 amino
%    acids long. \TeXtopo{} accepts definitions in the range of 14--36
%    amino acids. If the number of residues is below 14, which is 
%    definitively to short to span the membrane, a so-called 
%    `half-loop' is assumed as shown in the topology clipping in
%    Fig.÷\ref{fighalf}.
%    \medskip
%    
%    \begin{figure}
%    \begin{textopo}
%       \labelstyle{hl}{diamond}{Black}{Blue}{White}{}
%       \sequence{PQALPSV[LQIAMAFGLAIGTLVQALG]HV%
%       SGAH[([NNE,30]hl[box[Black,Blue]:Half loop[White]]=INPAVTVACL)]VGCHVSFLR}
%       \Nterm{extra} \hideNterm \hideCterm \hidelegend \labelTM{1}{II}
%       \labeloutside[right]{extra}
%    \end{textopo}
%    \caption{A `half loop' example}\label{fighalf}
%    \end{figure}
%    
%    The orientation of the protein in the membrane is determined by 
%    the location of the N-terminus. This information is provided
%    by PHD-, HMMTOP- and SwissProt files, when using alignment files in turn
%    the command |\Nterm{|\meta{location}|}| with \emph{location} =
%    \texttt{intra} or \texttt{extra}
%    \label{mNterm} can help out. If the N-terminus is not set \TeXtopo{}
%    assumes the N-terminus to be intracellular.
%    
%    
%    \subsubsection{Manual entry} 
%    \label{manual}
%    
%    Finally, the |\sequence| 
%    \label{msequence} command allows one to enter the sequence 
%    manually directly in the |textopo| or |helicalwheel| environment.
%    \medskip
%    
%    Syntax: |\sequence{|\meta{Amino acid sequence}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    This command provides a second possibility to define membrane domains in 
%    addition to |\MRs| overcoming the obstacle that one needs to know
%    the position numbers in order to use |\MRs|, which may result in an
%    annoying counting job. With |\sequence| the membrane regions can be
%    indicated by brackets directly in the amino acid sequence:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \vbox{%
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \sequence{MASEIKKKLFWRAV[VAEFLAMTLFVFISIGSA]LGFNYPLERN
%    QTLVQDN[VKVSLAFGLSIATLAQSVG]HISGAHSNPAVTL[GLLLSCQISILR

%    FGSAVLTRNFSNHWI[FWVGPFIGSALAVLIYDFI]LAPRSSDFTDRMKVWTSG
%    QVEEYDLDADDINSRVMKPK}
%    \end{verbatim}}
%    
%    Another feature of |\sequence| is its ability to print messages
%    containing position information during the \TeX{} run. Thus, if
%    one needs to know the position number of a special residue, 
%    say a secondary modification site, this residue can be
%    labeled with asterisks and the number will be displayed on the
%    screen.
%    \medskip
%    
%    \vbox{%
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \sequence{MASEIKKKLFWRAV[VAEFLAMTLFVFISIGSA]LGFNYPLER*N*
%    QTLVQDN[VKVSLAFGLSIATLAQSVG]HISGAHSNPAVTL[GLLLSCQISILR

%    FGSAVLTRNFSNHWI[FWVGPFIGSALAVLIYDFI]LAPRSSDFTDRMKVWTSG
%    QVEEYDLDADDINSRVMKPK}
%    \end{verbatim}}
%    
%    Screen output: |(pos `N': 42) (pos `C': 189)|
%    \medskip
%    
%    In addition, shading and labels can be set directly within the
%    |\sequence| command; this will be described later 
%    [\ref{mlabelregion}].
%    Do not forget to define the N-terminus location by |\Nterm| 
%    [\ref{mNterm}] if it is extracellular.
%    
%    
%    
%    \subsection{Structure modifications}
%    \label{strucmod}
%    
%    \subsubsection{Output size}
%    \label{outsize}
%    
%    \TeXtopo{} tries to select a font size for the residue symbols
%    that makes the plot fit onto the page without receiving \TeX{} error
%    messages. Actually, it only checks the width, so the user has to 
%    take care of the proper height. If the size is not satisfactory 
%    one can change it using |\scaletopo{|\meta{fixed or relative size}|}|. 
%    \label{mscaletopo}
%    There are ten different sizes to choose from which are referred 
%    to by the numbers 1 (very small) to 10 (huge). Any fixed size can be 
%    set by indicating the respective number, e.\,g.\ |\scaletopo{5}|.
%    Another possibility is to increase or decrease the size based on
%    the calculation \TeXtopo{} has made. Those relative settings are
%    done by entering a number with a `|+|' or `|-|'. For example,
%    |\scaletopo{+2}| will increase the font size by two steps 
%    relative to the calculation. After increasing the font size 
%    |overful hbox| error messages will most likely appear.
%    
%    
%    \subsubsection{Loop modifications} 
%    \label{loopmod}
%    
%    The height of the topology plot can be controlled by values
%    that define the extent of each loop above or beneath the membrane. 
%    The command \label{mloopextent}
%    |\loopextent[|\meta{loop}|]{|\meta{extent}|[|\meta{distance}|]}| 
%    takes three values which have the following effects: 
%    
%    \begin{description}
%    \item[\meta{extent}] is the only mandatory value needed by 
%       |\loopextent|. It sets the maximal number of residues in the
%       straight ascending or decending parts of the loop including 
%       the residues in the bend. Default setting is `30'.
%    \item[\meta{distance}] (optional) defines the minimum distance
%       of the loops from the membrane if the loop is plotted in a
%       meandrine shape. The default setting is `5'. Altering this setting 
%       might be necessary when flipping the termini to the interior of
%       the protein, see below.
%    \item[\meta{loop}] (optional) restricts the settings to a particular loop
%       number incl.\ N- and C-termini (`|N|', `|C|').
%       If this value is not set every loop is changed according to
%       the \meta{extent} and \meta{distance} values.
%    \end{description}
%    
%    Example A: |\loopextent[N]{50[10]}| sets the N-terminal loop to
%    a maximal extent of 50 residues with a minimal distance of 10.
%    \medskip
%    
%    Example B: |\loopextent[3]{30}| sets the third loop to a 30 residue 
%    extent keeping the default for \meta{distance}.
%    \medskip
%    
%    Example C: |\loopextent{40}| sets a general maximum of 40 
%    residues to all loops keeping the default minimal distance.
%    \medskip
%    
%    
%    Setting the maximal and minimal distances from the membrane
%    might not be sufficient for an optimal plot if the respective
%    loop is very long. When it is necessary to switch to the 
%    meandrine style the distance between the loop flanking transmembrane 
%    domains gets bigger and bigger. This can be avoided if a foot
%    with a fixed width in its `\emph{neck}'-part is added to the loop. 
%    The command \label{mloopfoot} 
%    |\loopfoot{|\meta{loop}|}{|\meta{direction}|[|\meta{neck}|]}|
%    does exactly that. Note that \meta{loop} is mandatory now with
%    the termini excluded. The \meta{direction} parameter can be 
%    |left|, |right| or |center|. This defines the direction of the
%    foot extension. Finally, the optional \meta{neck} value sets
%    the number of residues in the short straight part of the foot---I 
%    call it the \emph{neck}---and thus 
%    the distance from the membrane to the start of the opening of the foot.
%    Default setting here is `5'.
%    The actual loop is plotted atop of the foot according 
%    to the |\loopextent| value. This means, that loops with a foot have a
%    greater extent than loops without a foot. Thus, one might want
%    to adjust the |\loopextent| setting for those loops. The optional
%    parameter |[|\meta{distance}|]| in the |\loopextent| command is
%    ignored in |\loopfoot|. Figure \ref{foot} gives an example.

%    
%    A further change in the output can be achieved by flipping the

%    more compact plot on the one hand but makes
%    labeling more difficult due to less space on the other hand.
%    There are two commands available one for the N-terminus
%    (|\flipNterm|\label{mflipNterm}) and one for the C-terminus
%    (|\flipCterm|\label{mflipCterm}). This kind of structural
%    change might result in collisions with other loops. In such
%    a case one has to adjust the loop settings using
%    |\loopextent| or |\loopfoot|, see above. Fig.÷\ref{flip} shows the 
%    flipping effect.

%    \subsubsection{Membrane domains}
%    \label{memdom}
%    
%    The |\MRs| command has already been extensively described 
%    [\ref{mMRs}]. But in some cases it might be helpful to be
%    able to clear the membrane domain settings, e.\,g.\ if the
%    definitions or preditions of a SwissProt- or PHD-file are
%    not acceptable and new settings should be made. Therefore,
%    |\clearMRs| \label{mclearMRs} was implemented. This command 
%    is self-explanatory. It has an immediate clearing effect on the
%    settings before the command.
%    
%    Another structural feature should be discussed as a membrane
%    domain topic, i.\,e.\ lipid membrane anchors 
%    (|\anchor{|\meta{pos}|}|)\label{manchor}.
%    This very easy to use command draws a symbolic lipid chain to
%    the residue at position \meta{pos} and attaches it to the 
%    membrane. See Fig.÷\ref{figanchor} for an example.
%

%    \end{figure}
%    
%    
%    \subsubsection{Cosmetics on the membrane}
%    
%    As a default the membrane is shown as two horizontal lines
%    representing the borders. If a more solid appearance is
%    desired the command \label{mmembranecolors}
%    |\membranecolors{|\meta{border}|}{|\meta{interior}|}| can
%    be employed. It accepts PostScript color names (see 
%    section÷\ref{colors}) for \meta{border} and \meta{interior},
%    e.\,g.\ |\membranecolors{WildStrawberry}{Bittersweet}|. The
%    thickness of the border lines can be set by 
%    \label{mborderthickness} |\borderthickness{|\meta{length}|}|,
%    e.\,g. |\borderthickness{4mm}|.
%                
%    The short texts that indicate which side of the
%    membrane is oriented to the extracellular and to the intracellular 
%    space can be 
%    changed by |\labeloutside[|\meta{pos}|]{|\meta{text}|}| 
%    \label{mlabeloutside} and \label{mlabelinside}
%    |\labelinside[|\meta{pos}|]{|\meta{text}|}|. The optional parameter
%    \meta{pos} tells \TeXtopo{}
%    whether to put the label |left| or |right| on the membrane. 
%    \medskip
%    
%    Example: |\labeloutside[left]{blood}| |\labelinside{cytosol}|. 
%    \medskip
%    
%    No indication of a preferential side leads to printing on the
%    |left| for the outside label and on the |right| for the inside.
%    For a fine adjustment of the label positions use 
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad |\moveinsidelabel{|\meta{direction,distance} or \meta{x,y}|}|
%    \label{mmoveinsidelabel} and
%    
%    \label{mmoveoutsidelabel}
%    \quad |\moveoutsidelabel{|\meta{direction,distance} or \meta{x,y}|}|.
%    \medskip
%    
%    The parameter allows one to move the label
%    into \meta{direction} (see Fig.÷\ref{rosette}) for the amount of
%    \meta{distance} units; only integer values are accepted here. One unit
%    equals to $1/5$th of the diameter of the residue symbol. This 
%    scheme is also used for most of the other move-commands which
%    are described later. An example would be: 
%    |\moveinsidelabel{WSW,10}|.
%    
%    \begin{figure}
%    \begin{centering}
%    \tt
%    \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
%    NW  & NNW &     N     & NNE & NE  \\
%    WNW &     &           &     & ENE \\
%     W  &     & $\otimes$ &     &  E  \\
%    WSW &     &           &     & ESE \\
%    SW  & SSW &     S     & SSE & SE  \\
%    \end{tabular}
%    \caption{Directions for label movements from the center position.}
%    \label{rosette}
%    \end{centering}
%    \end{figure}
%    
%    Since v1.2 intuitive \emph{x/y}-values can be used to define the
%    new position besides the method described above. An example would
%    be: |\moveinsidelabel{10,-37}| which moves the label 10 units to
%    the right and 37 units down. 
%    
%    The standard width of the membrane is one residue
%    symbol broader than the extension of the N- and C-termini. If 
%    the termini are flipped to the inside, the calculation of the 
%    width is based on the transmembrane domains. In order the change
%    the width manually use the command \label{mbroadenmembrane}
%    |\broadenmembrane{|\meta{left/right}|}{|\meta{length}|}|. The
%    first parameter selects which end of the membrane is to be changed.
%    The \meta{length} is an integer value which tells \TeXtopo{}
%    by how much the width should be changed. One unit represents
%    again $1/5$th of the residue symbol. Negativ values are permitted
%    to shorten the membrane, e.\,g. |\broadenmembrane{left}{-20}|.
%    Analogous to broadening the membrane the thickness can be changed
%    by \label{mthickenmembrane} 
%    |\thickenmembrane{|\meta{top/bottom}|}{|\meta{length}|}|.
%    
%    |\hidemembrane| \label{mhidemembrane} makes the membrane totally 
%    disappear, whereas |\showmembrane| \label{mshowmembrane} brings
%    it back again. 
%    
%    
%    \subsection{Putting labels on the plot}
%    
%    \subsubsection{Labeling loops and membrane domains}
%    
%    By default transmembrane domains are labeled with upper case
%    roman numerals. This is achieved by using the command
%    |\labelTMs{|\meta{style}|}|\label{mlabelTMs} with
%    \meta{style} = |\Romancount| in the standard settings. All available
%    \meta{style} options are shown in the table below:
%    
%    \begin{center}
%    \begin{tabular}{ll}
%    \emph{counter} & \emph{display} \\[2mm]
%    \label{mnumcount}|\numcount|       & 1, 2, 3 \ldots \\
%    \label{malphacount}|\alphacount|   & a, b, c \ldots \\
%    \label{mAlphacount}|\Alphacount|   & A, B, C \ldots \\
%    \label{mromancount}|\romancount|   & i, ii, iii \ldots \\
%    \label{mRomancount}|\Romancount|   & I, II, III \ldots \\
%    \end{tabular}
%    \end{center}
%    
%    Mind the backslash! This option is actually a command which is
%    executed in the very moment the label is printed. One can 
%    also use combinations of text and a counter, e.\,g.
%    |\labelTMs{TM\numcount}|.
%    In order to set a label for one particular transmembrane
%    domain use 
%    |\labelTM[|\meta{direction,distance} or \meta{x,y}|]{|\meta{num}|}{|\meta{label}|}|
%    \label{mlabelTM} (singular! no `s'). \meta{num} indicates the 
%    number of the TM which is to be labeled with the text in
%    \meta{label}. The optional parameter can be used as 
%    described before [\ref{mmoveinsidelabel}]. Here, 
%    \emph{x/y}-values also work.
%        
%    One can move individual transmembrane domain labels without
%    having to take care of the label text by applying
%    the command \label{mmoveTMlabel}
%    |\moveTMlabel{|\meta{num}|}{|\meta{direction,distance} or \meta{x,y}|}|.
%    The first parameter \meta{num} refers to the domain number, the next 
%    pair of parameters corresponds to the ones described above. The
%    color of the labels is set by \label{mTMlabelcolor}
%    |\TMlabelcolor{|\meta{color}|}|. 
%    For a description of the color codes see section÷\ref{colors}.
%    The font styles are also adjustable, see section÷\ref{fonthandling}.
%    One final command concerning transmembrane domain labels is the
%    self-explanatory |\hideTMlabels|\label{mhideTMlabels}.
%    
%    Labels for the extra- and intracellular loops are handled exactly
%    in the same way as the transmembrane domain labels by the 
%    following set of commands:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\labelloops{|\meta{style}|}|\label{mlabelloops}
%    
%    \quad|\labelloop[|\meta{direction,distance} or \meta{x,y}|]{|\meta{num}|}{|\meta{label}|}|
%    \label{mlabelloop}
%    
%    \quad|\movelooplabel{|\meta{num}|}{|\meta{direction,distance} or \meta{x,y}|}|
%    \label{mmovelooplabel}
%    
%    \quad|\looplabelcolor{|\meta{color}|}|\label{mlooplabelcolor}
%    
%    \quad|\hidelooplabels|\label{mhidelooplabels}
%    \medskip
%    
%    Two pairs of special commands show or hide the extensions 
%    (\textsf{\small H$_{\mathsf{2}}$N--} and \textsf{\small --COOH}) at 
%    the N- and C-termini; these are \label{mshowNterm}\label{mhideNterm}
%    \label{mshowCterm} \label{mhideCterm}
%    |\showNterm|, |\hideNterm|, |\showCterm| and |\hideCterm|.
%    
%    
%    \subsubsection{Shading and labeling sequence features}
%    
%    The first thing to do before a certain residue or a sequence
%    domain can be labeled is to define an appropriate shading style for
%    this sequence stretch. Use the command \label{mlabelstyle}
%    |\labelstyle{|\meta{name}|}{|\meta{shape}|}{|\meta{frame 
%    color}|}{|\meta{background color}|}{|\meta{char color}|}{|\meta{legend 
%    text}|}| to set all necessary informations which are
%    needed to define the shading. The first parameter \meta{name} is
%    an `identification' of this specific label style. This is needed 
%    to be able to refer to it. Then,
%    the \meta{shape} (|circ|, |box| or |diamond|) and the colors
%    for the symbol's rim, its background and the character in the center are
%    set. The available colors are described in section÷\ref{colors}.
%    Finally, \meta{legend text} contains the text which is displayed
%    in the figure legend [\ref{mshowlegend}].
%    \medskip
%    
%    \vbox{%
%    Example: |\labelstyle{BlueDiamond}{diamond}|
%    
%                               \hfill|{Black}{Blue}{Yellow}{Example}|}
%    \medskip
%    
%    This new definition can be used from now on to shade and label one
%    or several single residues or sequence regions. It is a good
%    idea to store a collection of style definitions in a parameter
%    file (section÷\ref{paramfilestruc}) to have them at hand whenever
%    needed in future projects. The next command attaches
%    the label to the positions to be labeled: \label{mlabelregion}
%    |\labelregion[|\meta{direction,distance} or \meta{x,y}|]{|\meta{list of 
%    regions}|}{|\meta{style name}|}{|\meta{label text}|}|.
%    
%    This command is more complex than it seems at first sight. The
%    optional parameter |[|\meta{direction,distance}|]| can be
%    used to move the label to a new position. The usage is as in
%    |\moveinsidelabel| [\ref{mmoveinsidelabel}].
%    The third parameter \meta{style name} calls the style
%    definitions, i.\,e.\ for the example above it would be 
%    |{BlueDiamond}|. The complexity lies is the second and 
%    especially the fourth parameter. The \meta{list of 
%    regions} has a similar syntax as the list in the |\MRs| 
%    [\ref{mMRs}] command. But here, the definition of both, the start
%    and the stop position of each region can be followed by an optional 
%    \meta{direction} parameter, i.\,e.\     
%    \medskip
%    
%    \vbox{%
%    |{|\meta{start1|[|\meta{direction}|]|..stop1|[|\meta{direction}|]|},\ldots,
%    
%    \hfill\meta{start n|[|\meta{direction}|]|..stop n|[|\meta{direction}|]|}|}|.}
%    \medskip
%    
%    It happens sometimes---especially in the bends of loops---that the 
%    residue number is being printed over another residue. In such a case 
%    the \meta{direction} parameter lets one choose a new direction in which 
%    the number will be displayed. All direction definitions  
%    shown in Fig.÷\ref{rosette} are permitted. Note that here no 
%    setting of the distance is needed. If an asterisk is used as 
%    parameter the number will not be displayed at all. This might be
%    useful when positions are being labeled where not enough space is 
%    available for the number, e.\,g.\ within the dense
%    packing of a helical domain.
%    
%    Now, for the actual label text. The easiest way is to use plain
%    text as label. Then an example would simply be |{not fancy}|. If
%    one wants to add colors this has to be declared by an optional 
%    parameter right after the text, e.\,g.\ |{not fancy but red[Red]}|.
%    This text can further be boxed by extending the argument like
%    this: |{box:not fancy but red[Red]}|. A white box with a black frame
%    will be printed. Maybe colors would be nicer; an optional extension
%    does the job: |{box[Blue,Yellow]:not fancy but red[Red]}|. This will
%    produce a blue framed yellow box around the red text ``not fancy
%    but red'' which is quite fancy now. If the box frame and background 
%    are supposed to have the same color it is enough to indicate this only 
%    once, e.\,g.\ |{box[yellow]: ...}|. In addition to framed boxes two
%    more symbols are at hand: |{circ[col1,col2]: ...}| and
%    |{diamond[col1,col2]: ...}|. There is only space for
%    one letter in a circle or a diamond. If longer text is used it
%    will be printed over the rims of the symbol which looks rather
%    ugly. An appropriate application might be an encircled `P' to 
%    indicate a phosphorylation site. A last symbol |{tree}| does
%    not accept any text; it is meant to indicate glycosylation sites.
%    
%    The following example uses the previously defined shading style 
%    `BlueDiamond' for the residues and prints a red colored text in a 
%    blue framed yellow box to label the sequence stretch from position 20 to
%    30 and the single residue 76. Further, the labels are moved
%    westwards by 10 units (= 2 residue diameters) and the first position
%    number is hidden, the second is displayed beneath the residue,
%    whereas the third is not altered.
%    \medskip
%    
%    \vbox{%
%    \quad |\labelregion[W,10]{20[*]..30[S],76..76}{BlueDiamond}|
%    
%                      \hfill |{box[Blue,Yellow]:red plain text[Red]}|}
%    \medskip
%    
%    It should be mentioned that there are already two
%    shading styles predefined in \TeXtopo{} called |standard|
%    and |noshade|. The former style uses the definitions of the
%    standard residues for the labeled positions, the latter
%    style can be used to attach a label to a certain residue or
%    domain without influencing the residues. Such kinds of labels 
%    are handy when using calculated shading [\ref{mapplyshading}]
%    that should not be depended on any kind of labels.
%    
%    It is also possible to make almost all these settings directly 
%    in the |\sequence| [\ref{msequence}] definition similar to the
%    declaration of the membraneous domains [\ref{align}] without
%    knowing the position numbers. However, the command structure
%    will get rather complex and makes the readability of the
%    sequence worse the more optional parameters are defined. The 
%    following example uses the settings as the example above.
%    \medskip
%    
%    \vbox{%
%    |\sequence{MLNLFMISLDRYCAVMDPL|
%    
%    |([W,10]BlueDiamond[box[Blue,Yellow]:red plain text[Red]]=|
%    
%    |YPVLVTPVRVA)ISLVLIWVISITLSFLSIHLGWNSRNETSKGNHTTSKCKVQVNEV|
%    
%    |([W,10]BlueDiamond[box[Blue,Yellow]:red plain text[Red]]=|
%    
%    |G)LVDGLVTFYLPLLIMCITYYRIFKVARDQAKRINHISSW ...}|}
%    \medskip
%    
%    As I said, it gets complex. One might figure out how to use
%    this shading definition from the shown example. There is
%    one restriction of this method: the printing direction of the
%    position numbers relative to the residue can not be
%    influenced. Nevertheless, this 
%    kind of labeling might be useful for brief plain labels. For more
%    complex labels one better takes one extra step to figure out the 
%    exact position numbers by using `|*|'s in the |\sequence| command
%    [\ref{msequence}] in order to set the label afterwards with 
%    |\labelregion|.
%    
%    Two often occuring modifications can be labeled using some kind
%    of `short-cut' commands, i.\,e.\ \label{mphosphorylation}
%    |\phosphorylation{|\meta{list of positions}|}| and 
%    \label{mglycosylation}
%    |\glycosylation{|\meta{list of positions}|}|.
%    \medskip
%    
%    Example: |\phosphorylation{10,45,99} \glycosylation{123}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    Minor alterations concern the color of the residue number which
%    can be changed by |\countercolor{|\meta{color}|}| 
%    \label{mcountercolor} (again, for
%    colors see section÷\ref{colors}), and the thickness of the line
%    that connects the label with the residue \label{mrulethickness}
%    (|\rulethickness{|\meta{thickness}|}|. Two examples:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad |\countercolor{Blue} \rulethickness{2pt}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    
%    \subsubsection{Placing additional labels}
%    
%    All kinds of labels discussed before are attached or related to
%    some protein segments. The command \label{mplace}
%    |\place[|\meta{num}|]{|\meta{x\%}|,|\meta{y\%}|}{|\meta{label}|}| 
%    allows one to place any kind of text to any position in 
%    the figure. The optional parameter \meta{num} is only 
%    necessary when plotting helical wheels [\ref{helwheel}].
%    The second parameter lets one set the position of the label.
%    The system underlying the position calculation differs from
%    that described in the previous commands. Here, the x- and
%    y-positions are expressed as percentages (\textit{x\%}
%    and \textit{y\%}) of the total width and height of the
%    plot with the origin in the lower left corner. So, |{0,0}|
%    places the label in this corner, |{0,100}| in the upper
%    left, |{100,0}| in the lower right, |{100,100}| in the 
%    upper right corner and |{50,50}| in the center of the figure.
%    Of course, any other setting is also permitted. \meta{label}
%    finally, holds the label text which can further contain any
%    desired \LaTeX{} style modification command.
%    \medskip
%    
%    Example: |\place{10,90}{\textbf{\Large Topology example}}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    
%    \subsubsection{Adding protein tags and changing the numbering}
%    
%    In some cases the protein which is plotted contains artificial
%    tags for affinity purification, e.\,g.\ a oligo-His-tag, for
%    antibody detection, e.\,g.\ a myc-tag, or for other purposes,
%    e.\,g.\ a GFP-fusion etc. Using \TeXtopo{} one can attach
%    those tags to the termini of the protein without altering its
%    numbering, i.\,e.\ the sequence tagged to the N-terminus will
%    be numbered with negative digits so that the original 
%    start-methionine will still be number one. The syntax of the
%    commands for adding tags to the N- and C-terminus is very similar 
%    to the |\labelregion| command [\ref{mlabelregion}]:
%    \label{maddtagtoNterm}\label{maddtagtoCterm}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \vbox{%
%    \quad|\addtagtoNterm[|\meta{direction,distance} or \meta{x,y}|]{|\meta{tag sequence}|}|
%    
%    \hfill|{|\meta{style name}|}{|\meta{label text}|}|}
%    
%    \vbox{%
%    \quad|\addtagtoCterm[|\meta{direction,distance} or \meta{x,y}|]{|\meta{tag sequence}|}|
%    
%    \hfill|{|\meta{style name}|}{|\meta{label text}|}|}
%    
%    \medskip
%    
%    In contrast to |\labelregion| no definition of the positions is
%    necessary because the location is clear anyway (N- or C-terminus).
%    Instead of that the sequence of the tag needs to be entered as the
%    second parameter. Everything else is identical to |\labelregion|.
%    \medskip
%    
%    Example: |\addtagtoNterm[N,8]{MEQKLISEEDAAA}{myc}{myc-tag}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    This attaches a myc-tag and a spacer of three alanines to the 
%    N-terminus, shades the tag with a style named |myc| and prints
%    the label text |myc-tag| which is moved to the North by eight
%    units. The following original start-methionine still is no.÷1, whereas
%    the new start-methionine of the myc-tag is no.÷$-13$, then 
%    counting up to $-1$ for the last of the three alanines.
%    
%    Another possibility to change the residue numbering is the command
%    \label{mseqstart}|\seqstart{|\meta{num}|}|. This lets one set
%    any number---except 0---as the sequence start. One application
%    would be proteins with pro-peptides. Here, the pro-peptide could 
%    be negatively numbered ending up with no.÷1 at the starting position
%    of the mature protein.
%    
%    
%    \subsubsection{Applying calculated shading}
%    \label{appshad}
%    
%    As already pointed out in section÷\ref{ts},
%    a special feature of \TeXtopo{} is its ability to communicate
%    with \TeXshade{} and use the shading calculated by this
%    comprehensive alignment shading programm in a topology
%    plot to indicate residue conservation or functional aspects,
%    see examples in Fig.\ \ref{figshad} and \ref{figwheelshad}. 
%    
%    In order to use \TeXshade{}'s calculated residue shading in 
%    to\-po\-lo\-gy plots
%    the package must be loaded in the document header by
%    |\usepackage[|\meta{option}|]{texshade}|. This command must be given \emph{before}
%    loading the \TeXtopo{} package! This is due to some 
%    re-definitions \TeXtopo{} does on \TeXshade{} commands. So,
%    the document header must contain the following two commands:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \vbox{%
%    \quad|\usepackage[|\meta{option}|]{texshade}|
%    
%    \quad|\usepackage[|\meta{option}|]{textopo}|}
%    \medskip
%    
%    A safer possibility is to load both biological packages by declaring 
%    \label{mbiotex}|\usepackage[|\meta{option}|]{biotex}| instead of the commands above. 
%    \BioTeX{} does not provide new command definitions; it only
%    organizes the loading of the packages (so far \TeXshade{} and
%    \TeXtopo{} are available---but the collection is going to be
%    extended) in the correct order and checks for the appropriate
%    version numbers. The \BioTeX{} style has been produced automatically
%    when \TeXtopo{} was extracted from the docstrip archive. Keep
%    this file in a directory searched by \TeX, e.\,g.\ together
%    with your \TeXtopo{} files.
%    
%    At this point
%    it is refered to the \TeXshade{} manual for an extensive
%    description of the different shading modes. Here, only
%    a basic overview will be given.
%        
%    \begin{description}
%    \item[Identity mode:]
%    This basic type of shading is provided by almost any alignment
%    program. All identical residues at a position are shaded if the
%    number of matching residues is higher than a given threshold
%    percentage.
%    \medskip
%    
%    
%    \item[Similarity mode:]
%    Consider an alignment position where three out of five residues are basic
%    arginines and two more residues are also basic lysines.
%    In similarity mode \TeXshade{} shades similar residues in a different 
%    color to distinguish them from the consensus residue. Even when 
%    none of the residues alone reaches the 
%    threshold but a group of similar residues does these are shaded
%    in the `similarity' color. This case is given for instance
%    when at a position in a five sequence alignment two aliphatic 
%    valines and two also aliphatic isoleucins are present and the 
%    threshold is set to 50\%. Neither residue exceeds this percentage 
%    but as a group of similars they do. 
%    
%    \item[Functionality modes:]
%    Displaying functional peptide similarities is one of \TeXshade's
%    strong capabilities. Six functional shading modes are predefined,
%    see references [4--7];
%    further user specific modes can easily be created.
%    
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item |charge|: residues which are charged at physiological pH
%                    (7.4) are shaded if their number at a position
%                    is higher than the threshold
%                    
%    \item |hydropathy|: discrimination between acidic and
%                        basic, polar uncharged and hydrophobic nonpolar residues
%    
%    \item |structure|: displays the potential
%                        localization within the tertiary structure of
%                        the protein 
%    
%    \item |chemical|: residues are shaded due to chemical 
%                      properties of
%                      their functional groups
%                      
%          
%    \item |standard area|: this shading displays the surface 
%                      area sizes
%                      of the different amino acid's sidechains
%                      
%    \item |accessible area|: 
%                     here, the surface area which can
%                     be accessed by solvent molecules is used as a 
%                     basis for shading; low accessibility means 
%                     hydrophobic (i.\,e.\ strongly buried 
%                     residues), whereas highly accessible 
%                     sidechains are hydrophilic (compare to
%                     |hydropathy| and |structure|)
%    \end{itemize}
%    \end{description}
%    
%    For the first two modes (|identical|, |similar|) an
%    alignment file containing the sequence to be plotted is needed
%    on which the shading calculation will be based. The syntax
%    is as follows:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \label{mapplyshading}
%    \quad|\applyshading[|\meta{num}|]{|\meta{mode}|}{|\meta{filename}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    The optional \meta{num} tells \TeXtopo{} which sequence number within
%    the alignment corresponds to the sequence to be plotted. If no 
%    \meta{num} is indicated the top sequence will be taken (no.÷1).
%    The second parameter \meta{mode} selects the shading mode. Options
%    are |identical| and |similar|. Finally, the file name of the
%    alignment is the argument of the third parameter. For the
%    alignment file formats see the \TeXshade{} manual and the example
%    files |AQPpro.MSF| and |AQP2spec.ALN| or \ref{align}. 
%   
%    All \TeXshade{} commands
%    are applicable to obtain the desired shading, e.\,g.\ 
%    \label{mthreshold}|\threshold|, \label{mshadingcolors}|\shadingcolors| or 
%    \label{mallmatchspecial}|\allmatchspecial|. The function of these
%    commands is to set the threshold percentage for the consensus, e.\,g.\ 
%    |\threshold{50}|, select another colorscheme (see section÷\ref{colused}),
%    e.\,g.\ |\shadingcolors{greens}|, or use a special color
%    for positions where all residues match. The counterpart of 
%    |\allmatchspecial| is \label{mallmatchspecialoff}|\allmatchspecialoff|.
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\applyshading[3]{similar}{file.MSF} \allmatchspecial|
%    \medskip
%    
%    This example calculates shading for the third sequence of the alignment 
%    file |file.MSF| and shades all similar and conserved positions plus the 
%    positions with 100\% identity in different colors. See also the
%    example on page \pageref{tsexample}.
%    
%    The colors for each matching quality are changeable by the next
%    four commands:
%    \label{mstandardresidues}
%    \label{msimilarpositions}
%    \label{mconservedpositions}
%    \label{minvariablepositions}
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\standardresidues{|\meta{style}|}{|\meta{frame}|}{|\meta{background}|}{|\meta{char}|}|
%    
%    \quad|\similarpositions{|\meta{style}|}{|\meta{frame}|}{|\meta{background}|}{|\meta{char}|}|
%    
%    \quad|\conservedpositions{|\meta{style}|}{|\meta{frame}|}{|\meta{background}|}{|\meta{char}|}|
%    
%    \quad|\invariablepositions{|\meta{style}|}{|\meta{frame}|}{|\meta{background}|}{|\meta{char}|}|
%    
%    \medskip
%    
%    The \meta{style} options are: |circ|, |box|, and |diamond|. The
%    next three parameters are color definitions for the symbol
%    \meta{frame}, its \meta{background}, and the residue \meta{char}.
%    \medskip
%    
%    Example: |\conservedpositions{circ}{Black}{Blue}{White}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    
%    
%    Mostly, in alignments the starting methionine is shaded with the
%    color for highly conserved residues, simply because every protein
%    starts out with a methionine, except for the cases where some
%    kind of maturation takes place. Anyway, this methionine has 
%    usually no particular function in the protein. Hence, the 
%    shading for it is deactivated by default in \TeXtopo{} by the
%    command \label{mdonotshadestartMet}|\donotshadestartMet| in 
%    the standard settings. To re-active the shading use 
%    \label{mshadestartMet}|\shadestartMet|.
%    
%    The third group of functional shading modes is calculated on the
%    topology sequence itself. Hence, no alignment file must be
%    loaded which changes the |\applyshading| command somewhat:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\applyshading[|\meta{parameterfile}|]{|\meta{mode}|}{|\meta{group}|}|
%    
%    \medskip
%    
%    Here, \meta{mode} is |functional| and \meta{group} is one of the
%    amino acid groupings described above (|charge|, |hydropathy|,
%    |structure|, |chemical|, |sidechain area|, and |accessible area|).
%    The optional parameter loads a \TeXshade{} parameter file. This 
%    allows one to apply shading modes from a user-defined collection without 
%    any hassles.
%    \medskip
%    
%    Example: |\applyshading{functional}{charge}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    This shades all charged residues in the topology plot according
%    to the color definitions of the functional shading mode
%    |charge|, see section÷\ref{colused}.
%    
%    Again, it is refered to the \TeXshade{} manual for an extensive
%    exploitation of the given possibilities.    
%    
%    
%    \subsubsection{The figure legend}
%   
%    Legends are automatically printed when necessary, i.\,e.\ when
%    labels are used [\ref{mlabelstyle}] or calculated shading is 
%    applied [\ref{mapplyshading}]. Then, an example residue is 
%    shown and the explanation of the shading behind it, as
%    defined in |\labelstyle| or in the shading mode. The output of
%    the legend can be suppressed by \label{mhidelegend}|\hidelegend|,
%    or if needed turned on again by \label{mshowlegend}|\showlegend|.
%    If the position of the legend below the figure is not satisfying
%    one can move it using the command \label{mmovelegend}
%    |\movelegend{|\meta{x-offset}|}{|\meta{y-offset}|}|. The two 
%    parameters are \TeX{} lengths, e.\,g. |\movelegend{5cm}{-3cm}| 
%    moves the legend 5\,cm to the right and 3\,cm up.
%    
%    
%    \subsection{Plotting helical wheels}
%    \label{helwheel}
%    
%    Almost everything that has been said before is also true for
%    using the |helical wheel| environment [\ref{wheelenv}]. One can
%    load and label the sequence exactly as described before. There is one 
%    minor restriction to the labeling: in helical wheels no label
%    text will be displayed. But the |\place| [\ref{mplace}] command is
%    fully functional. Here, the optional parameter refers to the wheel, 
%    i.\,e.\ the number of the transmembrane domain, in which the 
%    label is to be placed. The \meta{x\%} and \meta{y\%} values
%    are now according to the dimensions of one wheel rather than the
%    whole figure.
%    
%    The style of the helix (perspective, flat wheel or net) can be
%    set by the command |\helixstyle{|\meta{style}|}| 
%    \label{mhelixstyle} with |perspective|, |wheel| or |net| as 
%    \meta{style}. The different outputs are shown in Figure 
%    \ref{figstyle}. 
%    
%        
%    \begin{figure}

%    
%    In the |net| display the optional parameter
%    which can follow the wheel number in the |\begin{helicalwheel}|
%    call (see \ref{wheelenv}) does not represent an angle but defines 
%    where to start the net plot. Numbers from 1--7 are allowed here. 
%    This can be handy if a certain viewing angle on the helix should 
%    be displayed in order to show e.g. a hydrophobic core.
%    Figure \ref{netstart} examplary shows all possible starting points 
%    of the same helical sequence.

%    \end{figure}
%    
%    The size of the wheels can be changed by the 
%    |\scalewheel{|\meta{scale\%}|}|\label{mscalewheel} command.
%    The wheel's original diameter is multiplied by the given
%    percentage to increase (\meta{scale\%} $>100$) or decrease 
%    (\meta{scale\%} $<100$) the
%    output.
%    \medskip
%    
%    Example: |\scalewheel{50}| reduces the diameter to 50\%
%    \medskip
%    
%    The size of the residue symbols can then be adjusted by
%    the command \label{msymbolsize}|\symbolsize{|\meta{size}|}|. Three 
%    \meta{size}s are applicable: |small|, |medium| and |large|.
%    
%    Depending on the diameter of the wheel \TeXtopo{} calculates
%    the highest possible number of wheels which can be printed
%    in one row without colliding with the text width settings. If
%    the number of wheels per line should be altered the command
%    \label{mwheelsperline}|\wheelsperline{|\meta{num}|}| will
%    help. Changing the calculated amount of wheels per line will
%    most probably result in \TeX{} run-time warnings due to
%    |overful hbox|es.
%    
%    One can choose the viewing direction on the helical wheels by
%    \label{mviewfromextra}|\viewfromextra| and 
%    \label{mviewfromintra}|\viewfromintra|. The first setting
%    will show the helices as if viewed from the extracellular space 
%    onto the cell membrane (recognizable by the residue numbering) 
%    and vice versa for the second case. 
%    
%    In the perspective and the wheel display the hydrophobic moment
%    according to \textsc{David Eisenberg} of the helix can be shown as a line 
%    with a square at the end.
%    The direction of the line depicts the angle and the area of the
%    square the moment. To turn this on use |\showmoment| 
%    \label{mshowmoment} and |\hidemoment| \label{mhidemoment} turns it
%    off again. Different values obtained from the calculation can
%    be printed for every helix by the following commands with
%    \meta{helixnum} refering to the helix in question. These commands
%    can only be used outside the |helicalwheel| environment or in the 
%    caption.
%    \medskip
%    
%    \begin{centering}
%    \begin{tabular}{ll}
%       |\Hmean{|\meta{helixnum}|}|   & hydrophobicity per residue \\
%       |\muH{|\meta{helixnum}|}|     & ($\mu$H) hydrophobic moment \\
%       |\muHmean{|\meta{helixnum}|}| & hydrophobic moment per residue \\
%       |\mudelta{|\meta{helixnum}|}| & angle of the hydrophobic moment \\
%       \label{mHmean} \label{mmuH} \label{mmuHmean} \label{mmudelta} 
%    \end{tabular}
%    \end{centering}
%    
%    The color of the moment indicator can be changed by 
%    the command \label{mmomentcolor}
%    |\momentcolor{|\meta{color}|}|. The length of the line can be
%    scaled by \label{mscalemoment} |\scalemomemt{|\meta{scale\%}|}|
%    just like in the |\scalewheel| command mentioned before.
%    
%    
%    Finally, two command pairs show or hide the residue numbering
%    and the bonds between the residue symbols:

%    \subsection{Changing font styles}
%    \label{fonthandling}
%    
%    \label{msetfamily}\label{msetseries}
%    \label{msetshape}\label{msetsize}
%    The font styles for the legends, and the loop-, TM- and
%    residue labels can be changed by several commands.
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\setfamily{|\meta{text}|}{|\meta{family}|}|
%    
%    \quad|\setseries{|\meta{text}|}{|\meta{series}|}|
%    
%    \quad|\setshape{|\meta{text}|}{|\meta{shape}|}|
%    
%    \quad|\setsize{|\meta{text}|}{|\meta{size}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    The first parameter selects the text whose style is to be
%    changed. Possible first parameters are
%    |legend|, |labels|, |looplabels| and |TMlabels|.
%    \medskip
%    
%    The style is set by the second parameter:
%    
%    \begin{center}
%    \begin{tabular}{lll}
%    command & \meta{2. parameter} & \\
%    \hline
%    |\setfamily| & |rm| & modern roman font family \\
%           & |sf| & sans serif font family \\
%           & |tt| & typewriter font family \\ \hline
%    |\setseries| & |bf| & bold face series \\
%           & |md| & normal series \\ \hline
%    |\setshape|  & |it| & italics shape \\
%           & |sl| & slanted shape \\
%           & |sc| & small capitals shape \\
%           & |up| & upright shape \\ \hline
%    |\setsize|   & |tiny| & the known \TeX{} sizes \\
%           & |scriptsize| & \\
%           & |footnotesize| & \\
%           & |small| & \\
%           & |normalsize| & \\
%           & |large| & \\
%           & |Large| & \\
%           & |LARGE| & \\
%           & |huge| & \\
%           & |Huge| & \\ \hline
%    \end{tabular}
%    \end{center}
%    
%    Example: |\setfamily{labels}{it} \setseries{labels}{bf}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    \label{msetfont}
%    With the command
%    \medskip 
%    
%    \quad|\setfont{|\meta{text}|}{|\meta{family}|}{|\meta{series}|}{|\meta{shape}|}{|\meta{size}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    all four font attributes of one \meta{text} can be changed 
%    simultaneously. The order of the parameters is as indicated.
%    \medskip
%    
%    Example: |\setfont{labels}{rm}{it}{bf}{normalsize}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    Further, short commands are provided to change single font
%    attributes quickly. The following commands show examplary
%    how to change the settings for labels. 
%    \medskip
%    \enlargethispage{\baselineskip}
%    
%    \quad |\labelsrm| \quad |\labelstiny| \label{mlabelsrm}
%    
%    \quad |\labelssf| \quad |\labelsscriptsize|
%    
%    \quad |\labelstt| \quad |\labelsfootnotesize|
%    
%    \quad |\labelsbf| \quad |\labelssmall|

%    \quad |         | \quad |\labelsHuge|
%    \medskip
%    
%    Corresponding sets are provided for
%    loop labels (|\looplabelsrm| etc.), TM labels
%    (|\TMlabelsrm| etc.) and legend texts (|legendrm| etc.).

%    \section{The DVIPS color selection scheme}
%    \label{colors}
%    
%    \textsc{PostScript} provides 64 standard colors. All these 
%    colors are predefined in the |dvips| package. Each color
%    has a pictorial name such as |Bittersweet| and a distinct 
%    composition, e.\,g.\ 0\% cyan + 75\% magenta + 100\% yellow + 
%    24\% black---the so-called CMYK scheme. \TeXtopo{} enhances this
%    color scheme by gray scales in 5\% steps. 
%    The following colors and grays can be used in \TeXtopo{} by 
%    simply declaring the name of the color in the respective 
%    command, e.\,g.\ |\membranecolors|:
%    
%    
%    \begin{tabbing}

%    
%    Type the color names with the upper case letters exactly as described above.
%    For the definition of new colors use the |dvips| command in the
%    document header section:
%    \medskip
%    
%    \quad|\DefineNamedColor{named}{|\meta{name}|}{cmyk}{|\meta{C,M,Y,K}|}|
%    \medskip
%    
%    The \meta{name} can be chosen freely, the values for the color
%    composition must be in the range 0--1, i\,e.\ 0--100\% of the 
%    respective component (`C' -- cyan, `M' -- magenta, `Y' -- yellow,
%    `K' -- black) separated by commas.
%    \medskip
%    
%    Example: 
%    \medskip
%    
%    |\DefineNamedColor{named}{Salmon}{cmyk}{0,0.53,0.38,0}|

CC   -!- FUNCTION: FORMS A WATER-SPECIFIC CHANNEL THAT PROVIDES THE PLASMA
CC       MEMBRANES OF RED CELLS AND KIDNEY PROXIMAL TUBULES WITH HIGH
CC       PERMEABILITY TO WATER, THEREBY PERMITTING WATER TO MOVE IN THE
CC       DIRECTION OF AN OSMOTIC GRADIENT.
CC   -!- SUBUNIT: HOMOTETRAMER.
CC   -!- SUBCELLULAR LOCATION: INTEGRAL MEMBRANE PROTEIN.
CC   -!- TISSUE SPECIFICITY: ERYTHROCYTES AND RENAL TUBULES.
CC   -!- POLYMORPHISM: AQP1 IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COLTON BLOOD GROUP
CC       SYSTEM. APPROXIMATELY 92% OF CAUCASIANS ARE CO(A+B-) (ALA-45),
CC       APPROXIMATELY 8% ARE CO(A+B+), AND ONLY 0.2% ARE CO(A-B+) (VAL-
CC       45). CO(A-B-) WHICH IS VERY RARE, IS DUE TO A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF
CC       AQP1.
CC   -!- MISCELLANEOUS: PHARMACOLOGICALLY INHIBITED BY SUBMILLIMOLAR
CC       CONCENTRATIONS OF HG2+.
CC   -!- SIMILARITY: BELONGS TO THE TRANSMEMBRANE CHANNEL MIP FAMILY.

About the network method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The network procedure is described in detail in:
1) Rost, Burkhard; Sander, Chris:
  Prediction of protein structure at better than 70% accuracy.
  J. Mol. Biol., 1993, 232, 584-599.            

A brief description is given in:
  Rost, Burkhard; Sander, Chris:
  Improved prediction of protein secondary structure by use of se-
  quence profiles and neural networks.
  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1993, 90, 7558-7562.           

The PHD mail server is described in:
2) Rost, Burkhard; Sander, Chris; Schneider, Reinhard:
  PHD - an automatic mail server for protein secondary structure
  prediction.
  CABIOS, 1994, 10, 53-60.

The latest improvement steps (up to 72%) are explained in:
3) Rost, Burkhard; Sander, Chris:
  Combining evolutionary information and neural networks to predict
  protein secondary structure.
  Proteins, 1994,  19, 55-72.

To be quoted for publications of PHD output:
  Papers 1-3 for the prediction of secondary structure and the pre-
  diction server.



About the input to the network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The prediction is performed by a system of neural networks.
The input is a multiple sequence alignment. It is taken from an HSSP
file (produced by the program MaxHom:
  Sander, Chris & Schneider, Reinhard: Database of Homology-Derived
  Structures and the Structural Meaning of Sequence Alignment.
  Proteins, 1991, 9, 56-68.

For optimal results the alignment should contain sequences with varying
degrees of sequence similarity relative to the input protein.
The following is an ideal situation:

+-----------------+----------------------+
|   sequence:     |  sequence identity   |
+-----------------+----------------------+
| target sequence |  100 %               |
| aligned seq. 1  |   90 %               |
| aligned seq. 2  |   80 %               |
|      ...        |   ...                |
| aligned seq. 7  |   30 %               |
+-----------------+----------------------+



Estimated Accuracy of Prediction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A careful cross validation test on some 250 protein chains (in total
about 55,000 residues) with less than 25% pairwise sequence identity
gave the following results:

++================++-----------------------------------------+
|| Qtotal = 72.1% ||      ("overall three state accuracy")   |
++================++-----------------------------------------+

+----------------------------+-----------------------------+
| Qhelix (% of observed)=70% | Qhelix (% of predicted)=77% |
| Qstrand(% of observed)=62% | Qstrand(% of predicted)=64% |
| Qloop  (% of observed)=79% | Qloop  (% of predicted)=72% |
+----------------------------+-----------------------------+
..........................................................................

These percentages are defined by:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|                    number of correctly predicted residues
|Qtotal =            ---------------------------------------      (*100)
|                          number of all residues
|
|                    no of res correctly predicted to be in helix
|Qhelix (% of obs) = -------------------------------------------- (*100)
|                    no of all res observed to be in helix
|
|
|                    no of res correctly predicted to be in helix
|Qhelix (% of pred)= -------------------------------------------- (*100)
|                    no of all residues predicted to be in helix

..........................................................................

Averaging over single chains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most reasonable way to compute the overall accuracies is the above
quoted percentage of correctly predicted residues.  However, since the
user is mainly interested in the expected performance of the prediction
for a particular protein, the mean value when averaging over protein
chains might be of help as well.  Computing first the three state
accuracy for each protein chain, and then averaging over 250 chains
yields the following average:

+-------------------------------====--+
| Qtotal/averaged over chains = 72.2% |
+-------------------------------====--+
| standard deviation          =  9.3% |
+-------------------------------------+

..........................................................................

Further measures of performance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Matthews correlation coefficient:

+---------------------------------------------+
| Chelix = 0.63, Cstrand = 0.53, Cloop = 0.52 |
+---------------------------------------------+
..........................................................................

Average length of predicted secondary structure segments:

.           +------------+----------+
.           |  predicted | observed |
+-----------+------------+----------+
| Lhelix  = |    10.3    |    9.3   |
| Lstrand = |     5.0    |    5.3   |
| Lloop   = |     7.2    |    5.9   |
+-----------+------------+----------+
..........................................................................

The accuracy matrix in detail:

+---------------------------------------+
|    number of residues with H, E, L    |
+---------+------+------+------+--------+
|         |net H |net E |net L |sum obs |
+---------+------+------+------+--------+
| obs H   |12447 | 1255 | 3990 |  17692 |
| obs E   |  949 | 7493 | 3750 |  12192 |
| obs L   | 2604 | 2875 |19962 |  25441 |
+---------+------+------+------+--------+
| sum Net |16000 |11623 |27702 |  55325 |
+---------+------+------+------+--------+

Note: This table is to be read in the following manner:
     12447 of all residues predicted to be in helix, were observed to
     be in helix, 949 however belong to observed strands, 2604 to
     observed loop regions.  The term "observed" refers to the DSSP
     assignment of secondary structure calculated from 3D coordinates
     of experimentally determined structures (Dictionary of Secondary
     Structure  of Proteins: Kabsch & Sander (1983) Biopolymers, 22,
     2577-2637).



Position-specific reliability index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The network predicts the three secondary structure types using real
numbers from the output units. The prediction is assigned by choosing
the maximal unit ("winner takes all").  However, the real numbers
contain additional information.
E.g. the difference between the maximal and the second largest output
unit can be used to derive a "reliability index".  This index is given
for each residue along with the prediction.  The index is scaled to
have values between 0 (lowest reliability), and 9 (highest).
The accuracies (Qtot) to be expected for residues with values above a
particular value of the index are given below as well as the fraction
of such residues (%res).:

+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| index|  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |
| %res |100.0| 99.2| 90.4| 80.9| 71.6| 62.5| 52.8| 42.3| 29.8| 14.1|
+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| Qtot | 72.1| 72.3| 74.8| 77.7| 80.3| 82.9| 85.7| 88.5| 91.1| 94.2|
|      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| H%obs| 70.4| 70.6| 73.7| 77.1| 80.1| 83.1| 86.0| 89.3| 92.5| 96.4|
| E%obs| 61.5| 61.7| 63.7| 66.6| 69.1| 71.7| 74.6| 77.0| 77.8| 68.1|
|      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| H%prd| 77.8| 78.0| 80.0| 82.6| 84.7| 86.9| 89.2| 91.3| 93.1| 95.4|
| E%prd| 64.5| 64.7| 67.8| 71.0| 74.2| 77.6| 81.4| 85.1| 89.8| 93.5|
+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

The above table gives the cumulative results, e.g. 62.5% of all
residues have a reliability of at least 5.  The overall three-state
accuracy for this subset of almost two thirds of all residues is 82.9%.
For this subset, e.g., 83.1% of the observed helices are correctly
predicted, and 86.9% of all residues predicted to be in helix are
correct.

..........................................................................

The following table gives the non-cumulative quantities, i.e. the
values per reliability index range.  These numbers answer the question:
how reliable is the prediction for all residues labeled with the
particular index i.

+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

About the network method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The network for prediction of secondary structure is described in
detail in:
  Rost, Burkhard; Sander, Chris:
  Prediction of protein structure at better than 70% accuracy.
  J. Mol. Biol., 1993, 232, 584-599.

The analysis of the prediction of solvent exposure is given in:
  Rost, Burkhard; Sander, Chris:
  Conservation and prediction of solvent accessibility in protein
  families.  Proteins, 1994, 20, 216-226.

To be quoted for publications of PHD exposure prediction:
  Both papers quoted above.



Definition of accessibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For training the residue solvent accessibility the DSSP (Dictionary of
Secondary Structure of Proteins; Kabsch & Sander (1983) Biopolymers, 22,
2577-2637) values of accessible surface area have been used.  The
prediction provides values for the relative solvent accessibility.  The
normalisation is the following:

|                           ACCESSIBILITY (from DSSP in Angstrom)
|RELATIVE_ACCESSIBILITY =   ------------------------------------- * 100
|                               MAXIMAL_ACC (amino acid type i)

where MAXIMAL_ACC (i) is the maximal accessibility of amino acid type i.
The maximal values are:

+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|  A |  B |  C |  D |  E |  F |  G |  H |  I |  K |  L |  M |
| 106| 160| 135| 163| 194| 197|  84| 184| 169| 205| 164| 188|
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|  N |  P |  Q |  R |  S |  T |  V |  W |  X |  Y |  Z |
| 157| 136| 198| 248| 130| 142| 142| 227| 180| 222| 196|
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

Notation: one letter code for amino acid, B stands for D or N; Z stands
  for E or Q; and X stands for undetermined.

The relative solvent accessibility can be used to estimate the number
of water molecules (W) in contact with the residue:

W = ACCESSIBILITY /10

The prediction is given in 10 states for relative accessibility, with

RELATIVE_ACCESSIBILITY = (PREDICTED_ACC * PREDICTED_ACC)

where PREDICTED_ACC = 0 - 9.



Estimated Accuracy of Prediction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A careful cross validation test on some 238 protein chains (in total
about 62,000 residues) with less than 25% pairwise sequence identity
gave the following results:


Correlation
...........

The correlation between observed and predicted solvent accessibility
is:

-----------
corr = 0.53
-----------

This value ought to be compared to the worst and best case prediction
scenario: random prediction (corr = 0.0) and homology modelling
(corr = 0.66).  (Note: homology modelling yields a relative accurate
prediction in 3D if, and only if, a significantly identical sequence
has a known 3D structure.)


3-state accuracy
................

Often the relative accessibility is projected onto, e.g., 3 states:
  b  = buried       (here defined as < 9% relative accessibility),
  i  = intermediate ( 9% <= rel. acc. < 36% ),
  e  = exposed      ( rel. acc. >= 36% ).

A projection onto 3 states or 2 states (buried/exposed) enables the
compilation of a 3- and 2-state prediction accuracy.  PHD reaches an
overall 3-state accuracy of:
  Q3 = 57.5%
(compared to 35% for random prediction and 70% for homology modelling).

In detail:

+-----------------------------------+-------------------------+
| Qburied       (% of observed)=77% | Qb (% of predicted)=60% |
| Qintermediate (% of observed)= 9% | Qi (% of predicted)=44% |
| Qexposed      (% of observed)=78% | Qe (% of predicted)=56% |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------+


10-state accuracy
.................

The network predicts relative solvent accessibility in 10 states, with
state i (i = 0-9) corresponding to a relative solvent accessibility of
i*i %.  The 10-state accuracy of the network is:

  Q10 = 24.5%

..........................................................................

These percentages are defined by:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|                     number of correctly predicted residues
|Q3               = ---------------------------------------      (*100)
|                           number of all residues
|
|                     no of res. correctly predicted to be buried
|Qburied (% of obs) = ------------------------------------------- (*100)
|                     no of all res. observed to be buried
|
|
|                     no of res. correctly predicted to be buried
|Qburied (% of pred)= ------------------------------------------- (*100)
|                     no of all residues predicted to be buried

..........................................................................

Averaging over single chains
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most reasonable way to compute the overall accuracies is the above
quoted percentage of correctly predicted residues.  However, since the
user is mainly interested in the expected performance of the prediction
for a particular protein, the mean value when averaging over protein
chains might be of help as well.  Computing first the correlation
between observed and predicted accessibility for each protein chan, and
then averaging over all 238 chains yields the following average:

+-------------------------------====--+
| corr/averaged over chains   = 0.53  |
+-------------------------------====--+
| standard deviation          = 0.11  |
+-------------------------------------+

Note: This table is to be read in the following manner:

     observed with 0% relative accessibility.  However, 325 of all
     residues predicted to have 0% are observed as completely exposed
     (obs = 9 -> rel. acc. >= 81%).  The term "observed" refers to the
     DSSP compilation of area of solvent accessibility calculated from
     3D coordinates of experimentally determined structures (Diction-
     ary of Secondary Structure  of Proteins: Kabsch & Sander (1983)

Position-specific reliability index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The network predicts the 10 states for relative accessibility using real
numbers from the output units. The prediction is assigned by choosing
the maximal unit ("winner takes all").  However, the real numbers
contain additional information.
E.g. the difference between the maximal and the second largest output
unit (with the constraint that the second largest output is compiled
among all units at least 2 positions off the maximal unit) can be used
to derive a "reliability index".  This index is given for each residue
along with the prediction.  The index is scaled to have values between
0 (lowest reliability), and 9 (highest).
The accuracies (Q3, corr, asf.) to be expected for residues with values
above a particular value of the index are given below as well as the
fraction of such residues (%res).:

Abbreviations as before.

The above table gives the cumulative results, e.g. 45.8% of all
residues have a reliability of at least 4.  The correlation for this
most reliably predicted half of the residues is 0.686, i.e. a value
comparable to what could be expected if homology modelling were
possible.  For this subset of 45.8% of all residues, 89% of the buried
residues are correctly predicted, and 72% of all residues predicted to
be buried are correct.

     were observed either inside or outside of the protein, i.e. in
     loop (or non-membrane) regions. The term "observed" refers to DSSP
     assignment of secondary structure calculated from 3D coordinates
     of experimentally determined structures (Dictionary of Secondary
     Structure  of Proteins: Kabsch & Sander (1983) Biopolymers, 22,
     2577-2637) where these were available.  For all other proteins,
     the assignment of trans-membrane segments has been taken from the

     As helical trans-membrane segments are longer than globular heli-
     ces, correctly predicted segments can easily be made out.  PHDhtm
     misses 5 out of 258 observed segments, predicts 6 where non is
     observed and 3 times the predicted helical segment overlaps two
     observed regions.  Thus, in total more than 95% of all segments
     are correctly predicted.

Position-specific reliability index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The network predicts two states: helical trans-membrane region and rest
using two output units.  The prediction is assigned by choosing the ma-
ximal unit ("winner takes all").  However, the real numbers of the out-
put units contain additional information.
E.g. the difference between the two output units can be used to derive
a "reliability index".  This index is given for each residue along with
the prediction.  The index is scaled to have values between 0 (lowest
reliability), and 9 (highest).
The accuracies (Qtot) to be expected for residues with values above a
particular value of the index are given below as well as the fraction
of such residues (%res).:

+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| index|  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |
| %res |100.0| 98.8| 97.3| 95.9| 94.1| 92.3| 89.9| 86.2| 75.0| 66.8|

|      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

| H%obs| 91.8| 92.9| 93.8| 94.4| 95.0| 95.7| 96.2| 96.8| 95.5| 78.7|
| L%obs| 95.3| 95.7| 96.1| 96.6| 97.0| 97.5| 98.1| 98.8| 99.7|100.0|
|      |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| H%prd| 82.7| 83.8| 85.0| 86.7| 88.1| 89.7| 91.4| 93.8| 96.3| 97.1|

+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

The above table gives the cumulative results, e.g. 92.3% of all
residues have a reliability of at least 5.  The overall two-state
accuracy for this subset is 97.2%.  For this subset, e.g., 95.7% of
the observed helical trans-membrane residues are correctly predicted,
and 89.7% of all residues predicted to be in helical trans-membrane
segment are correct.







The resulting network (PHD) prediction is:

---   Dear user,                                                          ---
---                                                                       ---
---      as of  January 1, 1997,  EMBL has effectively decided to not     ---
---   support the PredictProtein service by personal resources.  I do     ---
---   maintain the program, so to speak, in my private time. However,     ---
---   my contract obliges me to do science, instead.   Unfortunately,     ---
---   the computer environment at  EMBL  is at the same time starting     ---
---   to become increasingly unstable.   Consequence of these two re-     ---
---   cent developments is that the  PredictProtein service is not as     ---
---   stable as it was.                                                   ---
---                                                                       ---
---      I apologise for the problems this may cause.  In particular,     ---
---   I apologise for my inability to reply to the 20-30 daily,  per-     ---
---   sonal mails, and suggest to  re-submit requests after 24 hours!     ---
---                                                                       ---
---   Hoping  that I shall  find  a more convenient  solution for the     ---
---   future of the PredictProtein I remain with my best regards,         ---
---                                                                       ---

---   many hickups over the next months (as I shall leave EMBL). How-     ---
---   ever, the server seems to have a fair chance of survival thanks     ---
---   to a major support that is being raised by Columbia University,     ---
---   New York, U.S.A.).   I hope that this will settle the issue for     ---
