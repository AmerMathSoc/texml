% This extension package complements the greek option of the \babel\
% package so as to enable the use of the Lipsian\footnote{What here
% are called Lipsian fonts are a family of fonts that in Greece are
% called ``Lipsiakos''; they are similar to the ones that were being
% used in the Teubner Printing Company of Lipsia from mid XIX century on.}
% fonts and to use several macros for inserting special annotations
% in the written text, as well as to typeset verses with special
% layout. Metric sequences may be defined and typeset by means of a
% companion font \texttt{gmtr????} that follows the same conventions
% as the CB fonts that are normally used when the \babel\ |greek|   
% option is in force.
%
% Examples and lists of commands are available in the file
% \texttt{teubner-doc.pdf} which, as a regular pdf file, embeds all
% the necessary fonts and may be read on screen as well as printed on paper;
% beware, though, that the PostScript fonts that are being used
% in \texttt{teubner-doc.pdf} are not installed by default if a basic
% installation is sought.
%
% This version 4.0 tries to adapt to the new handling of the Greek language
% by \babel, since now this language script is based on the
% LICR (\LaTeX\ Internal Character Representation), and source files now can 
% include Greek glyphs, besides the usual transliteration with Latin letters.
% \end{abstract}
%
% \section{Introduction}
% Philologists in general have the necessity of using special
% alphabets and several special symbols in order to mark up their
% texts and to typeset them in a special way. Greek philology makes
% no exception, therefore I prepared this file and some extra fonts
% in order to complement what is already available with the |greek|   
% option of the \babel\ package.
%
% I must warmly thank Paolo Ciacchi of the University of Trieste who
% invited me in this ``adventure'', since I know nothing about
% philology; he assisted me with all his competence, so that I
% could learn so many new things and I could appreciate the world of
% philologists.
%
% Paolo Ciacchi's ``invitation'' arrived when I was almost finished
% with the design of the Lipsian font family; I was working on this new
% typeface after a kind request by Dimitri Filippou, with whom I
% already collaborated for other questions related to Greek
% typesetting. I warmly thank also Dimitri Filippou for the
% patience with which he revised every single glyph of the new
% typeface. Paolo Ciacchi added his constructive criticism to the
% typeface, especially for what concerns diacritical marks. At the
% end I think that the new typeface turned out pretty well thanks to
% both my friends.
%
% The Lipsian font, also called Leipzig, or Lipsiakos in Greece, is one of the
% oblique fonts that used to be employed by the typesetters working in the
% German city of Leipzig, among which the Teubner Printing Company.
% This Company's classical works of ancient Greek poetry are considered among
% the best ever published. The name of this file and this extension
% package is in honour of that printing company.
%
% This package documentation does not contain any example written in
% Greek, because when you process this file it is very likely that
% you don't have the suitable Greek fonts and you must still download
% all or some of them. Therefore a companion file \texttt{teubner-doc.pdf}
% is included in this bundle where most, if not all, new commands
% are documented and suitably shown.
%
% This package contains new environments and new commands; it presumes
% the user invokes it after declaring the |greek| option to the \babel\
% package; should he forget, this package will complain. But once the
% |greek| option is properly declared, this package verifies that the
% |polutonikogreek| dialect (deprecated) is selected, or that the
% |polutoniko| attribute or modifier is set; if no attribute is set this package
% will set |polutoniko| or |ancient| depending on the presence of an
% updated Greek support to the \babel\ package. This choice depends on
% the particular version of the \babel\ package, but should not concern
% the user; switching back and forth between classical Greek and some
% modern western language is performed in a transparent way; possibly
% there might be some problem switching from classical to modern spelling
% in Greek itself, but since in modern spelling the multiplicity of Greek
% diacritical marks is not forbidden, it's the author choice to select
% classical or modern words, Lipsian or Didot fonts, polytonic or monotonic
% accentuation. The worst it can happen is that \babel\ uses just one
% hyphenation pattern set, so that in one of the three Greek versions some
% words might turn out with the wrong hyphens points.
%
% The CB Greek fonts, which have been available for some years now on
% \acro{ctan} in the directory \texttt{/fonts/greek/cb} have
% been completed with the new files for the Lipsian fonts, and the metric
% symbols font \texttt{gmtr????.*}; the latter does not need a formal font
% definition file, because the necessary definitions are included in this package.
% All fonts are available also as Type~1 scalable fonts. In general, recent
% distributions of the \TeX\ system already contain the necessary
% configuration to use the Type~1 font in one size, 10\,pt, but, thanks to
% scaling, these can be used at any size; this version of \textsf{teubner}
% is compatible with this reduced set. If optical sizes are desired for
% a more professional typesetting, the \acro{ctan} archives contain also
% the \textsf{cbgreek-full} package, which includes also all the Type~1
% fonts at the various standard (EC) sizes, plus other facilities that allow
% to use the CB fonts also in conjunction with the Latin Modern ones. Complete 
% installations of the \TeX\ system include the full CB fonts installation.
%
% The CB Greek fonts allow to input Greek text with a Latin keyboard and
% by employing the prefix notation; with a Greek keyboard and file
% \texttt{iso-8859-7.def} it is possible to directly input Greek text with the
% monotonic spelling; if polytonic spelling is required I fear that the above
% file is of little help and that a Latin keyboard does the job without
% an excessive burden. The recent modifications to the \babel\ package and of the 
% Greek language description file allow to enter also polytonic Greek text,
% keyboard permitting, with no effort; it is necessary to use the |utf8|
% input encoding. It's important to notice the Apple computers have available
% a virtual keyboard (called keyboard viewer) that is operable with the mouse
% and, just by selecting the \emph{Greek Polytonic} keyboard driver, the
% author can enter Greek text directly in the source file. Computer with a
% touch screen virtual keyboard allow to switch from the national to
% the Greek keyboard just by a single sweep of the finger. Some platforms
% have the possibility of switching keyboard but they don't show the new
% keyboard layout on the screen, but the user can generally build a personal
% table that describes the correspondence between the key board and the
% physical keyboard layout. Windows operating system Win8 has available
% a virtual keyboard similar to the Mac's.
%
% Nevertheless there is a little point to observe; Lipsian fonts are very
% nice but show some kerning errors with more evidence than the traditional
% Didot Greek fonts. With the prefix notation in force, kerning programs may
% result disabled and some diphthongs and some consonant-vowel combinations
% appear poorly matched when the second letter caries any diacritical mark. In
% order to avoid this ``feature'', the accented vowels may be input by means of
% macros, that directly translate to the accented glyph, rather than invoking the
% ligature programs that are implied by the prefix notation; reading a Greek text
% on the screen while editing the input \texttt{.tex} file when a Latin
% keyboard and such macros are used may be very strange, but authors get
% used to it, and agree that the effort is worth the result. The direct input
% of Greek glyphs, evidently is the real solution, even if it may be difficult
% to enter Greek glyphs without a suitable virtual keyboard or a suitable
% keyboard map.
%
% \section{Environments}
% I apologise if I chose Italian names for verse environments; I wanted to
% use names very different from the corresponding English ones, but at the
% same time easily recognisable; after all \emph{versi} is the plural of
% \emph{verso} and therefore is the exact Italian translation of \emph{verses}.
% If you feel more comfortable with Latin, the alias environment names
% in Latin, |versus|, |Versus|, and |VERSUS|, are also available.
%
% \DescribeEnv{versi}
%\DescribeMacro{\verso} 
% The environment \texttt{versi} (|versus|) is used to typeset verses
% in line, without an implicit end of line at the end of each verse; a vertical
% bar with a number on top of it marks the verse limit while allowing a numeric
% reference to a specific verse; the opening environment statement requires
% a string, a short text, in order to indent the verse lines the amount of
% this string width; the syntax is the following
% \begin{sintassi}
% \bslash begin\lbr versi\rbr\lbr\meta{string}\rbr{}
% \meta{verse}\bslash verso[\meta{starting number}]\meta{verse}\bslash verso
% \meta{verse}\bslash verso\meta{verse}\dots{}
% \bslash end\lbr versi\rbr
% \end{sintassi}
% where, of course, \meta{starting number} is required only for the first
% instance of |\verso| or when numbering must be restarted, for example
% after an ellipsis.
%
% \DescribeEnv{Versi}
% The environment \texttt{Versi} (|Versus|) is similar to the
% standard \LaTeX\ environment \texttt{verse}, except verse lines are numbered
% on multiples of~5; the opening statement requires the \meta{starting
% number} as an optional argument; if this optional argument is not specified,
% the starting number is assumed to be~1.
% \begin{sintassi}
% \bslash begin\lbr Versi\rbr[\meta{starting number}]
% \meta{verse}\bslash\bslash{}\meta{*}[\meta{vertical space}]
% \meta{verse}\bslash\bslash{}
% \dots{}
% \bslash end\lbr Versi\rbr
%\end{sintassi}
%
% \DescribeEnv{VERSI}
% \DescribeMacro{\SubVerso}
% \DescribeMacro{\NoSubVerso}
% The environment \texttt{VERSI} (|VERSUS|) allows for two verse
% enumerations; the main enumeration is identical to the one performed by
% the previous environment \texttt{Versi}, while the secondary enumeration
% is in smaller digits and normally numbers consecutive verses, except
% that it can be turned on and off; the verses that lack the secondary
% enumeration are indented by moving them to the right.
% \begin{sintassi}
% \bslash begin\lbr VERSI\rbr[\meta{starting principal number}]
% \meta{verse}\bslash\bslash\meta{*}[\meta{vertical space}]
% \bslash SubVerso[\meta{starting secondary number}]
% \meta{verse}\bslash\bslash\meta{*}[\meta{vertical space}]
% \dots{}
% \bslash NoSubVerso
% \meta{verse}\bslash\bslash\meta{*}[\meta{vertical space}]
% \dots
% \bslash end\lbr VERSI\rbr
% \end{sintassi}
% where if \meta{starting principal number} is missing, 1 is assumed,
% while if \meta{starting secondary number} is missing, the enumeration
% is continued from the next available integer. Of course
% \meta{starting secondary number} is used again when the secondary
% enumeration must be restarted; there are no means to restart the
% principal enumeration.
%
% \DescribeEnv{bracedmetrics} The previous environments accept \meta{verses}
% in any language and in any alphabet, the one that is in force before opening
% the environment; the language and, even less, the alphabet cannot be
% globally changed within the above environments; if such a change is performed,
% it is valid only for one verse, or for the remaining fraction of the verse
% after the language or font change. This means, among the other things, that
% if the default ``alphabet'' is the one that shows the metric symbols,
% the above environments may be used to display ``metric verses'', that is the
% pattern of long, short or ancipital symbols, together with any other metric
% symbol so as to display the metrics without disturbing the written text; when
% doing this metric typesetting, it may happen that some verse patterns exhibit
% some variants; in this case the \texttt{bracedmetrics} environment comes handy,
% because it can display such variants in separate lines but grouped with a large
% right brace; some commands allow to roughly align these variants, so as to
% allow to nest several such environments as if they were single blocks of metric
% symbols. The argument of the opening statement specifies the width of the
% block so as to align properly all the symbols even in nested environments.
% \begin{sintassi}
% \bslash begin\lbr bracedmetrics\rbr\lbr\meta{length}\rbr{}
% \meta{metric pattern}\bslash\bslash
% \meta{metric pattern}\bslash\bslash
% \dots{}
% \bslash end\lbr bracedmetrics\rbr
% \end{sintassi}
% \DescribeMacro{\verseskip}\DescribeMacro{\Hfill} Within the \meta{metric
% pattern} it is possible to flush right the symbols
% by prefixing the whole string with a |\Hfill| command; the \meta{length} may
% be specified as an integer multiple of a ``long'' symbol by means of
%\begin{sintassi}
% \bslash verseskip\lbr\meta{number}\rbr
%\end{sintassi}
% The macro |\verseskip| can be used also within \meta{metric pattern}
% in order to space out metric symbols.
%
% \section{Commands and symbols}
% This package defines a lot of commands for inserting special signs in the middle
% of regular text, for marking zeugmas and synizeses, for putting unusual accents
% on any symbol, for inserting special ``parentheses'' that are used by
% philologists for marking blocks of letters or blocks of text. I suggest that the
% user reads the documentation file \texttt{teubner-doc.pdf} for a complete
% list of commands and symbols.
%
% \DescribeMacro{\newmetrics} Here it might be useful to describe a command
% for defining metric sequences, so as to shorten the definition of metric verses;
% this new command is |\newmetrics| and may be used for the definition of new
% commands whose name \emph{may start with one digit}: precisely this digit may be
% one of~2, 3,~4. Even if \LaTeX\ does not allow macros to contain both digits
% and letters, other service macros have been defined so as to handle these
% special control sequences even if they start with \emph{one} digit strictly
% lower than~5. The syntax is:
% \begin{sintassi}
% \bslash newmetrics\lbr\meta{control sequence}\rbr\lbr\meta{definition}\rbr
% \end{sintassi}
% where \meta{definition} consists in general of a sequence of metric commands
% such as |\longa|, |\brevis|, |\anceps|, etc.
%
% \section{Acknowledgements}
% I must thank with gratitude Paolo Ciacchi that urged me to prepare this
% extension file in order to help him typeset his master thesis of philological
% kind in classical Greek.
%
% I am pleased to thank G\"unter Milde who wrote a definition file for accessing
% the LGR encoded fonts in order to fetch the accented glyphs; I kindly gave me
% permission to use his macros, that I adapted to the conventions used within this
% file. These macros were saved into the definition file |LGRaccent-glyph.def|, so
% that it could be used also without the |teubner| package, for example for
% typesetting without setting the \emph{polutoniko} language attribute. But
% since he became the maintainer of the Greek language support for the \babel\
% package, he extended this support to the point that the extended macros are
% already part of the new Greek support files.
%
% I got some ideas also from a paper that Werner Lemberg published on Eutypon, the
% magazine of the Hellenic Friends of \TeX, where he discussed in a constructive
% critical way the problems connected with the LGR encoded fonts and the Unicode
% encoding.
%
% Now the new Greek support for the \babel\ package, thanks to G\"unter Milde,
% includes also the support for Unicode input in the source file, in spite of
% using LGR encoded output fonts. The actual support is partially useful also
% with XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX.

% \section{Code}
% \subsection{Preliminaries}
% In order to use the PostScript pfb fonts (CM, EC, and CB) it is necessary to
% know if we are dealing with \LaTeX\ or pdf\LaTeX; this was necessary because
% apparently the pfb math scalable fonts derived from the \textsf{META\-FONT}
% counterparts do not have exactly the same effective dimensions; this is why
% the ``zeugma'' and the ``synizesis'' signs have to be corrected when the pfb
% fonts are used; with these, in facts, the black leader that joins the curved
% extremities appeared a little too fat and did not join exactly the left mark. 
% Recently, apparently, the fonts have been corrected and this trick is not
% necessary any more. Nevertheless  we define a new boolean that copes with the
% fact that at least since 2007 the \TeX\ engine is \textsf{pdftex} even when DVI
% output is sought; the package \pack{iftex} creates three |\if|s that allow to
% diagnose if the typesetting engine is \textsf{pdftex} in PDF mode, 
% \textsf{XeTeX} or \textsf{Luatex}; since at the moment this package
% \pack{teubner} is compatible only with \textsf{pdftex} in PDF mode, we equate
% the |\ifPDF| switch (defined in previous versions of \pack{teubner}) with the
% switch defined by package \pack{iftex}:

% package is set, but also that all the \babel\ machinery is available.
%
% Since \texttt{teubner.sty} accepts some options it is necessary to provide
% their definitions; in particular the |\or| control sequence conflicts
% with the |\or| primitive command used within the syntax of |\ifcase|\footnote{With
% version 2002/07/18 v.1.0d this has been eliminated; the option remains for
% compatibility with older versions, but the only legal command is now
% \texttt{\string\oR}.}; |\oR| is a little exception since all the other
% accent-vowel macros contain only lowercase letters; |og| is another exception,
% and the accent macros have to be used; |\og| collided with the French command
% for inserting the opening guillemets (see below). The point is that accent vowel
% sequences that directly access the accented glyph are made up as such:
% \begin{sintassi}
% \bslash \meta{base character}\meta{first diacritic}\meta{second diacritic}\meta{third diacritic}
% \textrm{where}
% \meta{first diacritic} \textrm{is \texttt{d} or \texttt{r}  or \texttt{s} for diaeresis, rough or smooth breath}
% \meta{second diacritic} \textrm{is \texttt{c} or \texttt{a} or \texttt{g} for circumflex or acute or grave}
% \meta{third diacritic} \textrm{is \texttt{i} for iota subscript or adscript}
% \end{sintassi}
% Evidently none of the diacritical marks is compulsory, but at least one must
% be present; if more than one is present it must be given in that sequence. Since
% |\oR| means omicron with rough breath, it is not very important that it is
% declared with the standard sequence |<o| or with |\oR| or with |\<o|, because
% it never falls after another letter, so that it never breaks any ligature or
% kerning command. The command is there just for completeness. More or less the
% same is true with the |\og| sequence; it fails to work correctly when the main
% language is French and the |french| option to the |babel| package is in force;
% matter of facts, |\og| conflicts with the homonymous command defined by that
% option to mean ``ouvrir guillemets''; therefore it's necessary to use
% either the plain sequence |`o| or the extended accent macro |\`o|.
%
% At the same time since all accent combinations are defined as ``text commands'',
% in \LaTeX\ jargon, when their commands are followed by a vowel (or `r') they
% define a ``text symbol'' i.e.\ they fetch directly the glyph of the accented
% character; therefore |<o|, |\oR| and |\r{o}| are all equivalent (at the
% beginning of a word where omicron with rough breath is the only place where you
% might find it). See more on this point in the following sections.
%
% These glyph name macros are not defined by default, because the |GlyphNames|
% boolean variable is false by default; you can specify the option
% \emph{GlyphNames} for activating these macro names.
% In any case the same result is more comfortably obtained by using the
% extended accent macros whose behaviour is specified by the new
% \babel\-greek settings.
%
% Another unusual option is set up for being used with non standard \TeX\ system
% fonts; we have noticed that the Lipsian fonts appear a little too light when
% used together with the Times or the Palatino fonts; probably this is true also
% with other PostScript fonts. In this case the user might specify the option
% |boldLipsian| and the Lipsian fonts used in medium series will be substituted
% with those of the semi\-bold one. 
%
% At the same time, from July 2005 and for a few years, the full collection
% of the complete size set of the CB fonts has not been available any more
% \emph{as the default \TeX\ system set up}; only the 10pt size were available
% unless the \texttt{cbgreek-full} font package was loaded; for this reason
% a new option was needed in order to instruct \texttt{teubner.sty} to use
% the specific file \texttt{type1ec.sty} dated at least 2002/09/07, so as to
% scale up or down all the EC and CB fonts from an original 10\,pt size.
% In order that the \texttt{10pt} plays its role correctly, it was convenient,
% if not compulsory, to require first the \texttt{babel} package, then the
% \texttt{teubner} one with the option \texttt{10pt}, then all other packages
% required for a specific document, in particular the \texttt{fontenc}
% one if the \texttt{T1} encoding is requested. All this is maintained for
% backward compatibility, and should not be necessary any more; now the
% complete set of the CB fonts gets installed with every full installation
% of the \TeX\ system, but with partial or basic installations, such option
% might turn out to be useful even now.
%
% This kludge is necessary for all fonts that have description files that use the
% |\EC@family| command for describing the available shapes and sizes; in practice
% this happens only with the EC fonts, even when the \texttt{cm-super} scalable
% implementation is used. For using the Latin Modern fonts (LM) new specific font
% description files for the CB fonts are part of the \babel\ package, so this
% problem does not exist; when using other fonts, such as the TX, PX, ZE,~\dots,
% other kludges are necessary, because their font family names are different from
% those normally used with \TeX: |cmr| for serifed fonts, |cmss| for sans serif
% ones, and |cmtt| for monospaced ones.\footnote{Even the Latin Modern fonts have
% different family names, but, due to their importance, specific font description
% files have been added to the \babel\ package. The LM fonts are more comfortable
% than the EC ones, when scalable fonts are to be used, because they are
% continuously scalable and download into the produced files less font files than
% the EC o cm-super ones. Unless specifically requested, the LM fonts should
% always be preferred to the EC and cm-super ones. When using the LM fonts, its
% better to use the full collection of the CB fonts, even if the CB font
% description files are compatible with the single 10\,pt size.}
%
% Notice that when using, for example, the TX fonts and no kludge is available,
% the CB fonts are loaded only as the ``error font'', since the TX fonts have
% different family names than the CB ones; in many cases this might pass
% un-noticed, but if real Greek text in different shapes and series has to be
% typeset, the unaware typesetter might get crazy trying to force shape and series
% changes in the Greek text; it would not be impossible, but it would be very,
% very boring. In any case see in the next sections the implemented kludges in
% order to run successful compilations also with non standard \TeX\ system fonts.

% In the next sections we frequently use the acronym for the Greek font encoding;

% font encodings, \texttt{T7} or \texttt{X7}\footnote{Apparently \texttt{T7} has been
% reserved to define an encoding where the first 128 glyphs are the standard
% \texttt{OT1} encoded Latin fonts, and the second group, again of 128 glyphs,
% contains the Greek characters; therefore, since polytonic spelling requires more
% than 128 glyphs, the extended encoding \texttt{X7} will probably become the one
% applicable to the whole set of the CB fonts. Time passing by, the \texttt{X7}
% encoding name apparently has been used for some nordic language.}.
% Meanwhile the acronym is \texttt{LGR}, so we'd better define a symbolic name, so

% Some macros are necessary to switch languages; such macros must be independent

% unknown, while the latter recognises varieties of the same language by the

% With \babel\ version 3.9g things have further changed; the attribute
% to a language may be appended to the language name with an interposed dot;
% for example for Greek it might be |greek.polutoniko|.
% Such macros, besides being as robust as possible, must provide the

%\begin{macro}{\GreekName}

% the attribute |ancient| may not be defined; in this case the |polutoniko|
% attribute is set, else the |ancient| attribute is selected. The difference
% is that the attribute |polutoniko| selects the polytonic spelling and the
% modern Greek hyphenation, while |ancient| selects the polytonic spelling and
% the classical Greek hyphenation. It is assumed that this |teubner| package
% gets used for philological purposes only for ancient Greek. Nevertheless,
% if some work on modern polytonic Greek philological document is being
% typeset, the |ancient| attribute may work satisfactorily, but with some
% possible ``ancient'' line breaks.

%\begin{macro}{\previousencoding}
% The ``default'' language is defined as the

% ones. 
%\end{macro}
%\end{macro}
%
%\begin{macro}{\substitutefontfamily}
%\begin{macro}{\ifLipsian}
% The font macro |\substitutefontfamily| is already present in the \babel\ kernel, but
% with version 3.9g it is deprecated, although maintained for backwards compatibility;
% it copes only with the standard families, series and shapes, therefore it does not
% consider the Lipsian shape and its series. I had to redefine it together with a
% new conditional macro in order to do the same job as the original one but taking
% into consideration also the Lipsian shape; the purpose of this macro is to write
% in the working directory a number of font description files that refer to the LGR
% Greek encoding, but have the names of the Latin font families; such font
% description files, simply substitute these non existent encoding-family series and
% shapes with the existing series and shapes of any other LGR encoded Greek font, in
% particular the CB ones.
% Things might change in the future, so as to use the package by G\"unter Milde
% \texttt{substitutefont} package (already present in the \acro{ctan} archive) or
% other solutions by the core of \babel. Meanwhile we cope with what is available
% right now.
%
% By issuing a command such as:
% \begin{sintassi}\ttfamily
% \texttt{\string\ifFamily}\{pxr\}\{cmr\}
% \end{sintassi}
% an association is made with all the series and shapes of the Palatino serifed
% fonts to the corresponding CB serifed series and shapes; therefore when a language
% shift changes the default encoding from, say, \texttt{T1} to  \texttt{LGR} the
% font family \texttt{LGR+pxr} is mapped to the font family \texttt{LGR+cmr} and
% everything is supposed to work fine; when another language change resets the
% encoding to \texttt{T1}, the original Latin script is used again. The redefined
% |\substitutefontfamily| macro is as such:

% These results are obtained by means of the following macros.
%\begin{macro}{\ifCMLM}
%\begin{macro}{\ifFamily}
% The |\ifCMLM| processes the necessary test in order to set the auxiliary macro
% |\n@xt| to be an alias to |\iftrue| or |iffalse| depending on the fact that the
% CM (or EC) fonts or the LM fonts are the default Latin ones, in this case it sets
% the |\n@xt| macro equivalent to |\iftrue|, otherwise it sets it to |\iffalse|. In
% order to succeed, it requires to analyse the first two letters of the default
% family name; if these letters form one of the sequences |cm| or |lm|, the CM or
% LM fonts have been loaded, otherwise some other fonts are in force. We need
% therefore a macro with delimited arguments in order to extract the first two
% letters of the family name.

% the Greek fonts by way of substitution. Let's explain again: if you specify

% you state that you want to run the macro on the serifed Palatino font family, by
% associating the |pxr| family to the |lmr| one\footnote{If you have the full CB
% Greek font collection it's more convenient to map the missing fonts to the Latin
% Modern Greek ones, while if you need to use the \emph{10pt} option, you'd better
% map the missing family to the ordinary Computer Modern ones; the actual fonts are
% the same, but the latter font definition files cope with the \emph{10pt} option,
% while the former don't.}; by specifying |\Lipsiantrue| you state that you want to
% create entries also for the Lipsian series and shape; the macro provides to reset 
% |\Lipsianfalse| in order to avoid that other calls of that macro on non serifed
% or monospaced fonts try to create entries that in any case do not exist: the
% Lipsian font comes only as a serifed font! In this way, if you are using
% Palatino fonts through the \textsf{pxfonts} package, the |teubner| macros provide
% to create the necessary font description files so that while you are typesetting
% in medium normal Latin Palatino and you switch to Greek, the built in macros
% change the encoding to LGR; the LGR Palatino serifed medium normal Greek font
% does not exist, but that family, series and shape are mapped by the font
% description file to the corresponding LGR encoded Latin Modern CB fonts in medium
% series and normal shape, and typesetting goes on with the right Greek fonts.

% You don't actually need to use that macro for the Times or the Palatino eXtended

% \textsf{pxfonts}, because a hook is set up so that ``at begin document'' the
% loading of those packages is tested, and if the test is true, the necessary font
% description files are possibly created. If you load the Times or the Palatino or
% any other non standard font by means of other packages, it's up to you to issue
% the |\substitutefontfamily| macro right after calling that font package and by
% using the correct family names; similarly you might substitute the new Latin font
% family names to other Greek font family names, if you have other fonts available.
% At the same time at begin document we memorise the name and encoding of the Latin
% font used for the default language, so that when returning to Latin font
% typesetting after Greek font typesetting, the proper language typesetting rules
% and encoding are restored.

% default one, in place of the OT1 encoding, then this choice must be made before
% this package is read in. Similarly when the \babel\ options are specified,

%\begin{macro}{\lishape}
%\begin{macro}{\textli}
% |\lishape| is the normal declaration, modelled on the other similar macros in the
% \LaTeX\ kernel, made up to chose the Lipsian shape. Nevertheless since it is a
% light character, if it must blend well with the other PostScript fonts, not only
% the CM and LM, but also the other ones available for typesetting with the \TeX\ 
% system, it is necessary to chose the |b| (bold) series in place of the |m|
% (medium) one, while maintaining the |bx| (bold extended) series when the other
% fonts are set with the blacker and larger series. This is why the |\lishape|
% declaration is a little more complicate than normal, since it has to test the
% value of the current series. The text command |\textli| matches the similar
% commands for Latin fonts. But the |\lishape| declaration is used also within the
% more complicated macros for declaring or setting the Lipsian font.
%
% |\Lipsiakostext| is a \emph{declaration} stating that from now on
% typesetting will be done with the Lipsian fonts; notice that the encoding and the

% \subsection{Service macros}
% Now we start the specific additions introduced with this package.
%
% \begin{macro}{\strip@pt}
% The \LaTeX\ kernel has the macro |\strip@pt| that strips off the pt part from the
% expanded value of a dimension register and makes available the measure in pt
% of the contained length (the register contains the length measure in scaled
% points; the expansion performed by \TeX\ with the command |\the| converts the
% scaled points to printer points and shows the result with a string of decimal
% digits with, possibly, a decimal fraction); its argument is supposed
% to be a dimension register name, not its expanded contents. The |\strip@pt|
% command eliminates the decimal point and the fractional part if the latter is
% nought.
%
% With the help of such service macro we are going to define a certain number of
% ``lift accent'' macros or ``put cedilla'' macros that work with both upright and
% slanted fonts, although they contain different parameters for Latin compared to
% Greek alphabets.
% \end{macro}
%
% \begin{macro}{\lift@accent}
% The first ``lift accent'' macro just puts an accent over
% a letter, without inserting any space between them; the first argument is the
% accent code (decimal, hexadecimal or octal; I prefer decimal), while the second
% argument is the letter --~any letter, even if it is not a vowel!
% \begin{macrocode}
\newcommand*\lift@accent[2]{\leavevmode
{\edef\slant@{\strip@pt\fontdimen1\font}%

%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
% \begin{macro}{\Lift@accent}
% The second ``lift accent'' macro behaves as the first one except it interposes a
% small vertical distance between the accent and the letter:
% \begin{macrocode}

%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
% \begin{macro}{\LIFT@accent}
% The third ``lift accent'' macro behaves as the first one, except it interposes a
% specified vertical space between the letter and the accent; this space is
% specified as the second argument:
% \begin{macrocode}
\newcommand*\LIFT@accent[3]{\leavevmode
{\edef\slant@{\strip@pt\fontdimen1\font}%
\dimen@=\z@\setbox\z@\hbox{\char#1}\advance\dimen@-.5\wd\z@

\raise\@tempdima\hbox to\z@{\kern\dimen@\char#1\relax\hss}\box\z@}}

%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
% All these macros will be used in subsequent ``put accent'' macros, that will
% stack also several accents one above the other; the necessity arises for example
% when the macron or breve diacritical marks have to be put over accented letters;
% according to typographical practice the accents must go over the macron or the
% breve.
% In a similar way philologists often must use other diacritical marks in addition
% to the traditional Greek ones, therefore these macros will be used, for example,
% for setting the Scandinavian ring (from a Latin font) over a Greek letter (from a
% Greek font).
%
% \begin{macro}{\cap@}
% The first such unusual diacritical mark is a small cap, a small upside down breve
% sign, that is in position~1 of the Greek font table.
% \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareRobustCommand{\cap@}[1]{\leavevmode
{\edef\slant@{\strip@pt\fontdimen1\font}%
\setbox\tw@\hbox{\fontencoding{\GRencoding@name}\selectfont

\raise\@tempdima\hbox to\z@{\kern\dimen@\box\tw@\relax\hss}\box\z@}}

%    \end{macrocode}
% The |\ifx\cf@encoding\GRencoding@name| conditional construct shows that this
% macro behaves differently with different font encodings; the following |\ifx#1k|
% checks the argument against the Greek letter kappa, which shows very clearly
% that these macros operate on any letter, not only on vowels.
% \end{macro}
%
% \begin{macro}{\cap}
% By means of the above |\cap@| macro we can define three equivalent commands to be
% used either when the Greek encoding is in force, or when one of the Latin
% encodings is in force; but we must pay attention, because there exist already
% the command |\cap| to be used in mathematics; therefore we better exclude this
% possibility through a clever use of the |\textormath| macro. Therefore we
% first save the math command into an alia |\mcap|; then we define three
% textual commands for the various encodings |\tcap|; finnally we use
% |\textormath|:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\let\mcap\cap
\DeclareTextCommand{\tcap}{\GRencoding@name}{\cap@}
\DeclareTextCommand{\tcap}{OT1}{\cap@}
\DeclareTextCommand{\tcap}{T1}{\cap@}
\DeclareRobustCommand*\cap{\textormath{\tcap}{\mcap}}
%    \end{macrocode}
% Probably one definition would be sufficient, but on one side the presence of three
% encoding dependent macros are the remains of initial works, while on the other
% side they prevent to use these macros with encodings for which the macro might not
% work well, because it was not tested with them.
% \end{macro}
%
% \begin{macro}{\cap@cedilla}
% Similarly a small cap can be put under another letter as it was a cedilla; for
% this task another macro is defined, which makes use of the same glyph in
% position~1 in the Greek font table:
% \begin{macrocode}
\newcommand*\cap@cedilla[1]{\leavevmode

%    \end{macrocode}
% \end{macro}
%
% \begin{macro}{\ring@cedilla}
% Another cedilla like diacritical mark is the Scandinavian ring put under a letter;
% the ring is taken from the metrics font, so its slot position does not depend 
% on the various Latin encodings; the correct positioning requires careful
% examination of the letter under which it is to be placed, distinguishing the Greek
% from the Latin encodings:

% \end{macro}
%
% \begin{macro}{\dot@cedilla}

% \end{macro}
%
% \subsection{Extended accent definitions}
% We will use those service macros in the definition of several accent like macros
% that keep all the intricacies away from the user. 
%
% In particular the \LaTeX\ kernel macros are used in order to declare accents,
% composite glyphs, composite commands, and the like; these are used as the default
% definitions; afterwards other definitions will be given that work when these
% composite macros don't work.
%
% In other words, while |\~| and |u| in Greek form the composite glyph ``upsilon
% with circumflex'' that exists in the Greek font table, the same macro |\~| and the
% letter |k| produce the  superposition of a circumflex on top of a ``kappa'' glyph,
% since this glyph does not exist in the Greek font table.
%^^A
%^^A NON SEMBRA CHE FUNZIONI CON TUTTI I COMANDI; CHIEDERE A GÜNTER
%^^A
% Notice that all these declarations are restricted to the Greek font encoding
% so they are usable only when such encoding is in force. See the
% |teubner-doc.pdf| file for more details concerning the usefulness of the
% extended accent macros vs.~the ligature mechanism. In any case, with version
% 3.9g of \babel\ and the modifications introduced by G\"unter Milde, the
% actual \babel\-greek maintainer, during the year 2013, such extended accent
% macros are LICR encoded and may always be used when typesetting in Greek;
% see file \texttt{greek-fontenc.def} and \texttt{lgrenc.def} for further
% details, remembering that such files are always loaded when typesetting
% Greek texts, irrespective of the input encoding; if the encoding is
% \texttt{utf8} direct Greek glyph input is possible (if your keyboard
% allows you to do such input).
% 
%\section{Avoiding conflicts}
% Some LICR definitions are necessary to use \pack{teubner}, but some of them
% are really important; therefore G\"unter Milde developed package
% \pack{textslpha} that comes with the other special files for the Greek LICR
% encoding, that avoids any conflict;we load it at the |\begin{document}|
% execution so that it will be loaded only if necessary:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\AtBeginDocument{\RequirePackage{textalpha}}
%    \end{macrocode}
% 
% \subsection{Special accent macros}
% Now we come back to the ``accent like'' and ``cedilla like'' general macros we
% defined above, and that will be extensively used in the following definitions.
% Note that for what the circumflex is concerned, when |teubner| is in effect it
% is not defined as an active character and does not work as a non breaking space.
% The command |\~| is just an accent macro; how do you put a non breaking space in
% a Greek context? By simply using the \LaTeX\ kernel macro |\nobreakspace|; when
% typesetting with non-Greek fonts the |~| is certainly handy
% to insert a non breaking space (a tie), but for polytonic Greek spelling in the
% past 15 years or so the Greek language definition file has always used the |~|
% sign a letter, not as an active character. If you look in the \babel\ package
% documentation related to the Greek language, you find that for what concerns the
% |~| with polytonic spelling a number of ``dirty tricks'' have been used, but
% nothing has been done to replace the ``tie'' function of this character when
% typesetting in languages that use the Latin script; the only action related to
% this point has been to redefine the kernel macros for typesetting figure and
% table% captions so as to substitute the |~| character with its explicit
% definition |\nobreakspace|. It is necessary to do the same when this package is
% used, although a shorter alias command |\nbs| is provided in order to simplify
% the input keying.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\let\nbs\nobreakspace
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% Before defining the Greek accents with the extended macros input with the 
% LICR accent macros, we have to define the accent superpositioning macros that
% with \pack{teubner} allow to stack from one to more accent over the base letter,
% taking into account the slant of the font from which the base letter is taken.
% Notice that these macros allow to set an accent on any base latter, even if that
% might be meaningless. At the same time we redefine the standard macros so as to
% let them do the same work when the LGR encoding is not in force. This duality is
% necessary, not only for backward compatibility, but also for avoiding that the
% normal redefined macros highjack the LICR facility.
%
% We first define aliases for the standard \LaTeX\ accents, so that when
% entering Greek typesetting mode we can save the \LaTeX\ macros, and restore
% them upon exiting:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\let\accacuto\' 
\let\accgrave\` 
\let\acccircon\~ 
\let\accdieresi\"
\let\accbreve\u
\let\accmacron\=
%    \end{macrocode}
% 
% Then we define alternate macros for these accents, as ``lifting'' accent macros,
% so that they can put their respective accent over any letter.
% For the diaeresis we need to put an invisible character (|v| in the LGR encoded
% CB fonts, that with LICR becomes |\textcompwordmark|) in order to avoid any
% ligature with an implied end of word (boundarychar) that turns the diaeresis
% into an apostrophe.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareTextCommand{\G}{\GRencoding@name}[1]{\lift@accent{96}{#1}}
\DeclareTextCommand{\A}{\GRencoding@name}[1]{\lift@accent{39}{#1}}
\DeclareTextCommand{\C}{\GRencoding@name}[1]{\lift@accent{126}{#1}}

% Most of the above accent commands are used again in order to tie a text symbol
% meaning to certain combinations, that is when they receive as argument a vowel
% whose accented glyph is present in the font; in this way in order to type
% ``alpha with rough breath, acute accent and iota subscript'' you can type
% \verb"<'a|", or \verb"\Ar{a}|" or |\arai| or \verb+\<'a|+, if you use the new standard 
% accent macros; the advantage of using the first notation is its short string; the
% advantage of the second is that it does not break kerning commands with a
% preceding letter; the advantage of the third is that it does not break any
% kerning either before or after; the fourth solution produces the same result as
% the third, but it's easier to make up and you don't have to memorise any specific
% naming rule for accented glyphs. With the Lipsian font this trick is particularly
% useful for any sequence of alpha and upsilon each one with its own accents and/or
% diaeresis.

% In Greek the regular cedilla is meaningless, so that |\c| may be redefined

% \subsection{Accent macros and glyph names}
% Now come dozens of macros that allow to access Greek accented vowels (plus rho
% with rough and smooth breaths) with macros instead of ligatures; such macros
% allow the kerning information to be used by \TeX, while the ligature mechanism
% would sometimes impeach the use of such kerning information. Notice that the
% same glyphs are often accessed with a ``text symbol'' or a ``text composite
% symbol''; as explained above the opportunity of using either one derives from
% the necessity of maintaining the kerning mechanism embedded in the font; if the
% CB fonts had a postfixed accent notation, instead of a prefixed one, none of
% these macros would be necessary (probably\dots!), but there would be other
% inconveniences.
%
% Notice that the following code is subject to the boolean variable |GlyphNames|
% which is set to \emph{false} by default, just for compatibility with the past;
% I suggest to use the \emph{GlyphNames} option when when you really want to use
% such macros; remember though that all these glyphs are more easily specified by
% means of the extended accent macros that are also less restricted in their
% names; for a letter marked with a smooth breath and an acute accent you can
% indifferently type before the letter one of the following |\>\'|, |\>'|, |\'\>|,
% |\'>| at your choice. Moreover you can always postfix the mark for the iota
% subscribed at the right of the letter, without any need o memorising complicated
% names.
%
% Notice the macros |\oR| and |\oG| that have the second letter capitalised in
% order to avoid conflicts with otherwise homonymous macros defined in the \LaTeX\
% kernel or in other packages; by maintaining the false value to the boolean
% variable |GlyphNames| you are sure to avoid conflicts.

% \subsection{Text philological symbols and macros}
% Next come some short macros for inserting special symbols that philologists
% use quite often in Greek. 
%\begin{macro}{\h}
% Macro |\h| is used to insert a Latin ``h'' while typesetting in Greek.
%\begin{macro}{\q}
% Macro |\q| is used to insert a Latin ``q'' while typesetting in Greek.
%\begin{macro}{\yod}
%\begin{macro}{\iod}
% Macros |\yod| and |\iod| are used to insert a
% Latin ``j'' while typesetting in Greek; the control sequence |\jod| was avoided in
% order to reduce the possibility of typing |\jot| which is a \TeX\ internal
% dimension.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareTextCommand{\h}{\GRencoding@name}%

%\begin {macro}{\f}
%\begin {macro}{\F}
%\begin {macro}{\digamma}
%\begin {macro}{\Digamma}
% At the same time it was believed that for inserting lower and upper case
% ``digamma'' it was preferable to use short macros and to avoid the dilemma between
% the |\ddigamma| and the |\digamma| macros, the former being the
% one defined in the |greek| option to \babel, the latter being
% a standard mathematical symbol; initially I believed that philologists do
% not use mathematical symbols so we made |\digamma| an alias for |\f|;
% afterwards I
% found out that mathematicians, physicists, engineers,~\dots\ use the
% \textsf{teubner.sty} package and that the |\digamma| is a symbol already defined
% in the package \textsf{amssymb.sty}; therefore I made a conditional creation of
% this alias; this trick is delayed to the beginning of the document, so as to
% make it independent on the order with which packages are loaded.

%
%\begin {macro}{\fLow}
%\begin {macro}{\fHigh}
% The digamma glyphs set forth another question because, according to Paolo
% Ciacchi, a different glyph should be used for typesetting text compared with
% the one that is used as a variant in Milesian numerals in place of the standard
% stigma symbol.
% By means of macros |\fLow| or |\fHigh| it is possible to chose the raised or the
% lowered digamma glyphs; Greek numerals always use the lowered one, while when
% text is being typeset the typesetter can chose the version he likes best.
%    \begin{macrocode}

%\begin{macro}{\rpar}
%\begin{macro}{\frapar}
% Here we start a set of miscellaneous macros. We begin with some parentheses
% that should turn out in upright shape, even if the default font is the Lipsian
% one which is oblique; its parentheses are oblique as in all oblique fonts,
% therefore we need to quietly change fonts behind the scenes. The same is true with
% the question mark that, philologically speaking, represents an uncertain element,
% not the termination of a real question; it should therefore always come out
% between parentheses and in upright shape from a Latin font. While the
% parenthesized question mark comes from the OT1 Latin upright font, the parentheses
% obtained with |\lpar| and |\rpar| are taken from the metric symbols font, as well
% as the parentheses used in the parenthesized text processed with macro |\frapar|.

% \subsection{Poetry environments and macros}
%\begin {macro}{\verso}
%\begin{environment}{versi}
% Here we start with verse environments; we already explained that we defined three
% new verse environments that typeset poetry in ``in-line'' verses,
% ``numbered by five'' verses, and ``numbered by five and subnumbered'' verses.
% For the environment |versi| we first need a counter and a little macro for
% generating the short bar that has to receive the verse number as a ``limits''
% superscript.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newcounter{verso}\setcounter{verso}{0}
\newcommand{\smallvert}{\vrule\@height.6ex\@depth.4ex}

%    \end{macrocode}
% Next we define the macro |\verso| that sets the small bar with the verse number on
% top. Since the initial numbering might be different from~1, |\verso| accepts an
% optional argument, which is intended to be the initial counter value. Since
% |\verso| steps up the counter a different action must be taken if the optional
% argument is present; in order to be able to reference such verse by means of the
% |\label|--|\ref| cross reference mechanism, this stepping up must be done by means
% of |\refstepcounter|; therefore we have to leave |\refstepcounter| outside the
% conditional code, and step down the counter by one unit only in case the initial
% value is specified.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareRobustCommand\verso[1][]{%
    \def\@tempA{#1}\ifx\@tempA\empty
    \else
        \setcounter{verso}{#1}\addtocounter{verso}{\m@ne}%
    \fi
    \refstepcounter{verso}%
    \@killglue\space
    \ensuremath{\mathop{\smallvert}\limits^{\scriptscriptstyle\theverso}}%
    \space\ignorespaces}

%    \end{macrocode}
% Now that the verse separation macro is ready we can define the environment; the
% required opening statement argument represents a short text whose width is taken
% as a measure for indentation, so that verses are typeset with a left margin that
% leaves out this short text. Substantially this environment is a \texttt{list} one,
% and the left margin variable width is totally similar to the one used in
% |thebibiography| environment. Also the |\makelabel| command has been modified
% accordingly.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newenvironment{versi}[1]{%
\def\makelabel##1{##1}
\setbox\z@\hbox{#1}%

\endlist
}
\let\versus\versi \let\endversus\endversi
%    \end{macrocode}
%\end{environment}
%\end{macro}
%
%\begin{environment}{Versi}
% The second environment |Versi| accepts an optional starting number in the opening,
% statement, whose default value is~1: verses are composed as in the standard
% \LaTeX\ |verse| environment (with one minor difference) except they are numbered
% in the left margin with a progression of five; only verse numbers that are integer
% multiples of five are displayed. The minor difference is that stanzas cannot be
% marked with a blank line in the input |.tex| file, as it is customary with
% the standard environment, but if a visual mark is desired, such as extra vertical
% space, it is necessary to resort to the optional spacing parameter that can be
% specified to the |\\| command. This environment uses the same verse counting
% counter, defined for use with the |versi| environment.
%
%\begin{macro}{\BreakVersotrue}
%\begin{macro}{\BreakVersofalse}
% For specific purposes it is necessary to have a boolean variable for allowing or
% prohibiting verses to split up at the end of line; the default is not
% to split.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newif\ifBreakVersi
\BreakVersifalse
\newenvironment{Versi}[1][1]{%
    \setcounter{verso}{#1}%
%    \end{macrocode}
%\end{macro}
%\end{macro}
% An internal macro |\writ@verso| does not actually write out the complete, possibly
% numbered verse, but provides for checking that the verse counter contains a
% multiple of~5, and to write it out using old stile numbers; in case the number is
% not an integer multiple of~5 the number is written out as the |\empty| macro.
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \def\writ@verso{%
        \count255=\value{verso}\divide\count255by5\relax
        \multiply\count255by5\relax
        \advance\count255-\value{verso}%
        \ifnum\count255=\z@
          {\fontseries{m}\small\expandafter\oldstylenums\expandafter{\the\c@verso}}%
        \else
          \empty
        \fi}%
%    \end{macrocode}
% Since the |\\| command should provide the same functionality as the regular
% \LaTeX\ command, while in this environment it should provide other
% functionalities, such as triggering the display of the verse number. It is
% necessary to define an intermediate command |\v@rscr|, that examines the possible
% optional arguments, such as the optional star or the brackets enclosing vertical
% spacing
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \def\acapo{\@ifstar{\v@rscr{\@M}}{\v@rscr{\z@}}}%
    \let\\\acapo
    \def\v@rscr##1{\@ifnextchar[{\wr@teverse{##1}}%
        {\wr@teverse{##1}[\z@]}}%
%    \end{macrocode}
% Finally the |\wr@teverse| macro does the actual typesetting of the verse. Notice
% that the environment opening statement and every succeeding previous verse starts
% an horizontal box where the contents of the current verse is stored. Therefore the
% first thing to do is to close the box with the |\egroup| command, then a line of
% text is output that contains a possibly empty box or the verse number and the
% command for stepping up the verse counter, followed by the verse box number~0 and
% an end of paragraph; in this way the |\\| operates always in vertical mode,
% contrary to what happens in the |verse| standard \LaTeX\ environment. Even in this
% environment the actual typesetting is done within a |list| environment, whose
% parameters are set differently from what they are in the |verse| environment.
% Notice in any case that the command |\wr@teverse| reopens the~0 box, so on the
% last verse, upon closing the environment, it is necessary to remember to close
% such box, whose contents is irrelevant and can be thrown away.
%
% I have experienced some problems in typesetting verses in two-column format; the
% column width might be too short for setting up verses even if verses are not that
% long, because in the left margin there must be room for the verse numbering; for
% homogeneity the spacing must conform also with the following environment
% \texttt{VERSI} that has a secondary verse numbering, therefore it can't be too
% small. The result is that there might be a test for controlling the two-column
% format, but I think that it is more useful for the typesetter to be able to switch
% on and off the possibility of breaking long verses on more lines.
% On two-column format in any case it is better to leave the right margin to
% coincide with the column right margin.

% the secondary enumeration.
% The new length represents an indentation of those verses that do no have the

% Similarly the following symbols have straightforward definitions. Only |\hiatus|

% in superscript position; in a first moment it was chosen the solution of designing
% a specific sans serif glyph in superscript position directly in the metric symbol
% font (actually this symbol is still part of the font), but while testing it, Paolo
% Ciacchi observed that a regular `H' with serifs was better looking than the sans
% serif counterpart. Therefore the definition was changed in order to use the
% current font upright shape; by specifying `H', it is irrelevant if the current one
% is a Latin font, and the letter is a capital 'h', or if the current one is a Greek
% font and the letter is a capital `eta'. |\Hiatus| displays the same symbol in a
% zero width box so that it does not occupy any horizontal space; it is useful while
% writing down complicated metric sequences. Macro|\X| may be considered, thanks to
% its shape, a mnemonic shortcut in place of the full name |\anceps|.

% the new metrics control sequence differently from the control sequences it uses

% The na\"if user can then type in something like \verb*+\2iamb + in order to

% die out by themselves when a group is closed, but it is a good habit to explicitly
% turn them out regardless of groups. Attention that when the tracing facilities are
% on and a page ship out takes place, the |.log| file receives a lot of material,
% and this file gets very large. In order to avoid logging too much information the
% |trace| package is loaded; this package give access to the macros |\traceon| and
% |\traceoff| that log a lot of information, except the redundant one, specifically
% all the macros executed during any font change. Users don't realize the amount of
% processing done behind the scenes when with the New Font Selection Scheme (NFSS) a
% font change takes place; luckily enough modern processors are quite fast so that
% the compilation CPU time does not become too heavy. But if the \TeX\ processing is
% logged, this amount of work implies thousands of lines of almost meaningless
% information when the purpose of logging depends on errors that are difficult to
% spot; Font changes are almost exempt from errors, so the processing of the inner
% workings need not be logged down.
%
% If the user needs to trace something in order to spot errors, s/he is invited to
% use the commands |\traceon| and |\traceoff|; commands |\TRON| and |\TROF| do log
% much more material, in particular font changes, but at least they action may be
% confined within groups or environments; |\GTRON| and |\GTROF| are global settings
% and can't be confined within groups or environments; sometimes they are necessary,
% but it's important to turn off global tracing as soon as possible.

% \subsection{Classical Greek numerals}
% When typesetting Greek it may occur to specify numbers written out as Milesian
% numerals; the |greek|    option to the \babel\ package defines a couple of
% macros for transforming explicit arabic numerals or counter contents as Milesian
% numerals. Since this package offers more possibilities in the choice of those
% ``non alphabetic'' characters used in the Milesian notation, such macros have to
% be redefined. On the occasion we changed some little internal details so as to make such macros a little faster and more robust.
%\begin{macro}{\Greeknumeral}
%\begin{macro}{\greeknumeral}
%\begin{macro}{\@ifStar}
%\begin{macro}{\grtoday}
% Both |\greeknumeral| and |\Greeknumeral|, the latter producing upper case Greek
% numerals, while the former produces lower case ones, resort to a service macro
% |\gr@@numeral|. But the new definition accepts the starred version; without the
% star the digit value~6 is represented with a ``stigma'', while with the star that
% value is represented with a lowered ``digamma''. The upper case version requires
% intermediate macros before using |\MakeUppercase| on the result in order to
% convert lower to upper case Milesian value symbols. This means that |\gr@@numeral|
% may work only with lower case symbols.
% It turned out that the normal redefinition command |\renewcommand| produced
% fragile commands that broke out when used as arguments of other commands,
% specifically the Greek date was broken when it was passed as the argument to the
% |\date| command of the class \textsf{memoir}; therefore I decided to redefine the
% |\@ifstar| macro into another |\@ifStar| one so as not to fiddle with \LaTeX\ 
% kernel commands. I defined also the lowercase version of the |\grtoday| date,
% since the \babel\ package provides only the |\today| command with no control over
% the use of which type of numerals; |\grtoday| uses the lowercase Milesian numerals
% through the redefined |\greeknumeral| macro.

% |\gr@@numeral| must do most of the processing; it must check that the argument is
% within the allowable range $1\sim999\,999$ and issue suitable warnings if not. On
% the other side, if the number is within the correct range, it must check in which
% decade it falls and must call other macros so as to produce the correct decimal
% digit~$\leftrightarrow$ Milesian symbol. Six such macros are needed because the
% allowable range contains at maximum six decimal places. Apparently Milesian
% symbology allows to go beyond one million, but Apostolos Syropoulos, who
% originally wrote the code thought (correctly) that Milesian numbers would not be
% used for ``acrobatic performances'' but possibly for writing the Greek date with
% the AD year; six decimal places are more than enough for this purpose.
% |\gr@ill@value| was not redefined from Apostolos Syropoulos' \babel\ definition;
% it simply issues a warning message about an argument out of range. The presence
% of the primitive command |number| in these macros is for two purposes:
% (a) transforms a counter contents into a sequence of digits tokens, and
% (b) if the argument is already a digit string, it removes any leading zeros.
% No braces are present because this string is examined sequentially one digit
% at a time from the leading position to the least significant position; of
% course this means that the decimal zero is treated correctly even if Milesian
% symbols do not have the equivalent of a zero.
% The double opening and closing braces are necessary to avoid a space vanishing
% after using the |\gr@@numeral| macro; the six levels of digit reprentation are

%\subsection{Attic numerals}
% It's true that Apostolos Siropoulos wrote also the |athnum.sty| extension package
% in order to typeset integer numbers with the Athenian or Attic notation; this
% representation of integer strictly positive integers was similar in a way to the
% Roman notation, based on a biquinalry representation of decimal digits (taking
% into account that there was not a symbol for zero) so as the Romans had the
% symbols for 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 (I, V, X, L, C, D, M) the Attic
% notation has symbols for the same sequence of decimal values extended with 
% 10\,000 and 50\,000. While typesetting philological texts in Greek it might be
% necessary to use also the Attic notation. % As the original Roman notation used
% to be purely additive (i.e.\ 9\,=\,VIIII), so is the Attic notation.
%
%\begin{macro}{\AtticNumeral}
%\begin{macro}{\AtticCycl@}
% Therefore another conversion macro was devised that receives the value to be
% converted as its argument and checks that it falls between the boundaries;
% actually the lower boundary is zero, while the upper boundary was chosen to be
% 99\,999, for no other reason that the lack of further symbols, beyond the value
% 50\,000, would force to long sequences of identical symbols that are difficult
% to read.  The |athnum.sty| package allows to extend this range to 249\,9999;
% should it be necessary, the user is invited to load that package and its
% transformation command |\athnum|.
%
% The user command |\AtticNumeral| is very simple, but it must be preceded by the
% definitions of the quinary symbols for 50, 500, 5000, and 50\,000; such symbols
% are present in all the CB Greek fonts in all sizes, series and shapes; therefore
% the definitions must be subject to the LGR enconding:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareTextSymbol{\Vmiria}{\GRencoding@name}{5}
\DeclareTextSymbol{\Vkilo}{\GRencoding@name}{4}
\DeclareTextSymbol{\Vetto}{\GRencoding@name}{3}
\DeclareTextSymbol{\Vdeka}{\GRencoding@name}{2}
%    \end{macrocode}
% The we need a command for issuing a warning message if the number to be
% transformed is out of range:
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newcommand*\attic@ill@value[1]{\PackageWarning{teubner}{%
Illegal value (\number#1) for \string\ActicNumeral\space}}
%    \end{macrocode}
% Finally the robust definition of the |\AtticNumeral| command"
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareRobustCommand*\AtticNumeral[1]{%
\ifnum#1<\@ne \attic@ill@value{#1}\else
  \ifnum#1>99999\relax \attic@ill@value{#1}\else
    \AtticCycl@{#1}%
  \fi
\fi}

%    \end{macrocode}
% The real transformation algorithm is transfered to the auxiliary macro
% |\AttiCycl@|, where successive division by 10 allow to extract the various decimal
% digits of various weights maintaining the remainder in the original counter; each
% decimal digit is possibly divided into the quinary value and the remaining units
% up to 4; the the cycle is repeated untile the decimal units, that do not require
% the computation of the remainder and terminate the cycle. Notice that we use also
% the $\varepsilon$-\TeX\ extended commands for integer computations; this implies
% that |teubner| mus be run with a suitably recent version of the typesetting engine
% that embeds the above extensions.

%\section{Accessing the CBgreek fonts when the TX fonts are selected}
% During the year 2010 this package \textsf{teubner.sty} was upgraded in order to allow
% using the CBgreek fonts even when other Latin fonts, different from the ``standard'' CM
% and LM ones are selected for typesetting text with the Latin script.

% At the same time Antonis Tsolomitis uploaded a new package in order to let
% Greek users use some Greek fonts that match the Times eXtended
% ones\footnote{Probably Antonis Tsolomitis' Greek fonts match also the
% newer Times eXtended fonts produced by Michael Sharpe. The newer fonts
% have different font family names than the previous TX fonts; in order
% to produce similar \texttt{.fd} files to be used with the newer Times
% fonts, it is necessary to procede as for any other font collection
% different from the TX ones.}. In order to use the de facto default
% encoding LGR for Greek fonts, he produced the necessary |lgrtxr.fd|,
% |lgrtxss.fd|, |lgrtxtt.fd|, font definition files that allow the font
% switching implied by the |greek| option to the \textsf{babel} package.
% These files take precedence over the mechanism outlined in
% section~\ref{ssec:LatinFontComp}, because command |\substitutefontfamily|
% first tests the existence of |lgrtxr.fd|, and, if this is not available,
% it may generate a specific one suitable for working smoothly with
% \textsf{teubner.sty}.
%
% Now if Tsolomitis' files are available on the main system tree, these
% take precedence and the \textsf{teubner} compatible files are not
% generated. Unfortunately Tsolomitis' fonts, although better suited to
% match the TX fonts, are well matched to modern Greek typesettin,
% but they are incomplete for philological typesetting.
%
% We therefore avoid this clash by creating a \textsf{teubnertx.sty} file.
% This extension defines the families and shapes available with the
% familiar fond definition files, but the information gets input by
% \textsf{teubner.sty} at the ``begin document'' time, without resorting
% to any |.fd| file. May be more information is loaded than is strictly
% necessary, but it better to do this way than to clash with other packages.
