% \section{Introduction}
%
%    The \rpack/ is a \latex/ package for bibliographies that provides an
%    archival data format similar to the format of \bibtex/ database
%    files, but adapted to make direct processing by \latex/ easier. The
%    package can be used either in conjunction with \bibtex/ or as a
%    replacement for \bibtex/.
%
%    This document is written for anyone who wants to implement a new
%    bibliography style for \pkg{amsrefs} or who is just curious about
%    how the package is implemented.
%    The reader should be familiar with the contents of the ``User's
%    Guide to the \pkg{amsrefs} Package''~\cite{Jones2004}
%    (\fn{amsrdoc.tex}).
%
%    For the publisher or implementor, the chief advantages of the
%    \rpack/ are as follows:
%    \begin{description}
%
%    \item[Preservation of structure]
%
%    The internal structural information of the bibliography entries is not
%    lost when they are imported from the database file into the \latex/
%    document. This takes on its greatest significance when archiving
%    documents in \latex/ form or transmitting them to another user (such as a
%    publisher).
%
%    \item[Deferred formatting]
%
%    This means that the style of the bibliography can be readily changed
%    without reimporting everything from the original database(s).
%
%    \item[Setup requires only \latex/ knowledge]
%
%    All bibliography setup can be done in \latex/; learning another
%    programming language (such as the one used in \bibtex/ \fn{bst}
%    files) is unnecessary.
%
%    \end{description}
%
% \section{Package options}
%
%    In addition to the options documented in the user's guide, there
%    are a few additional options that were omitted either because
%    they are obsolete or deprecated options included only for
%    backwards compatability or because they are still considered
%    experimental and not yet ready for widespread use.
%
%    \begin{description}
%
%    \item[?]
%
%    Informational option. This causes \pkg{amsrefs} to
%    display a pointer to the User's Guide on the terminal an in the
%    log file.  (In previous versions, it displayed much more
%    material, including a summary of package options.)
%
%    \item[traditional-quotes, logical-quotes]
%
%    With the \textit{traditional quotes} option
%    (default), quotation marks produced by \cn{bibquotes}
%    (\secref{misc-cmds}) fall outside of other punctuation, ``like
%    this,'' whereas with the \textit{logical quotes} option the order
%    is reversed, ``like this''.
%
% \end{description}
%
% \section{More about the \cn{bib} command}\label{bib-command}
%
% \subsection{Field names for the \cn{bib} command}
%
%    In addition to the fields discussed in the user's guide, the
%    following fields are used internally:
%    \begin{description}
%
%   \item[fulljournal]
%
%    Used internally by \cn{DefineJournal}.
%
%    \item[name]
%
%    Used internally by the \btype{name} bibliography type and
%    \cn{DefineName}.
%
%    \item[transition]
%
%    A dummy field used inside \cs{BibSpec}s when we want to force an
%    action unconditionally.
%
%    \end{description}
%
%    The following fields are included for backwards compatibility:
%    \begin{description}
%
%    \item[institution, school]
%
%    These are provided as aliases for \fld{organization} for
%    compatibility with \BibTeX.
%
%    \item[place]
%
%    A synonym for \fld{address}.  In earlier versions of
%    \pkg{amsrefs}, \fld{place} was preferred and \fld{address} was
%    considered as an alias for \fld{place}.  However, this seemed
%    like a gratuitous incompatibility with \BibTeX\ to me, so I have
%    reinstated \fld{address} as the primary field and \fld{place} is
%    now an undocumented alias.
%
%    \end{description}
%
%    The following fields are reserved for future use:
%    \begin{description}
%
%    \item[doi] Digital Object Identifier
%
%    \item[setup]
%
%    This is a special field that can be used to give arbitrary
%    commands to be executed at the beginning of the current \cn{bib}
%    entry, after all the fields have been read. The idea is that one
%    can alter the formatting of an individual entry through this
%    field, to handle special cases.
%
%    This is fully implemented, but I've been unable to think of any
%    good examples of its use; so, I've decided to suppress it until
%    such an example comes to light.
%
%    \item[url] Universal Resource Locator.
%
%    \end{description}
%
% \subsection{Bibliography entry types}
%
%    The following additional entry types (or, really, pseudo-entry
%    types) are used internally by \pkg{amsrefs}:
%    \begin{description}
%
%    \item[collection.article]
%
%    \item[proceedings.article]
%
%    \item[partial]
%
%    \item[conference]
%
%    \item[innerbook]
%
%    \item[name]
%
%    \item[nameLE]
%
%    \item[nameBE]
%
%    \item[nameinverted]
%
%    \item[publisher]
%
%    \end{description}
%
%    The following are currently undocumented aliases for various of
%    the standard types:
%    \begin{description}
%
%    \item[miscellaneous]
%
%    \item[periodical]
%
%    \end{description}
%
% \section{Customizing the bibliography style}\label{other-styles}
%
%    If you use the \rpack/ as is, the bibliography style you get is the
%    kind of style customarily seen in AMS publications. The recommended
%    way to get a different bibliography style is to write a \latex/
%    package which loads the \rpack/ with \cn{RequirePackage} and
%    then makes the desired changes by using suitable \cn{BibSpec}
%    commands as explained below. Thus, the general form of the custom
%    package will be
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \ProvidesPackage{xyzbib}[2002/11/06 v1.28]
%
%    \RequirePackage{amsrefs}\relax
%
%    \BibSpec{article}{
%      ...
%    }
%
%    \BibSpec{book}{
%      ...
%    }
%\end{verbatim}
%
%    The interior formatting within entries is specified by \cn{BibSpec}
%    commands, one for each entry type. To illustrate, let's look at an
%    example style specification for entries of type \btype{article}:
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \BibSpec{article}{%
%      +{}{\PrintAuthors}  {author}
%      +{,}{ \textit}      {title}
%      +{,}{ }             {journal}
%      +{}{ \textbf}       {volume}
%      +{}{ \parenthesize} {date}
%      +{,}{ }             {pages}
%      +{,}{ }             {note}
%      +{.}{}              {transition}
%      +{}{ }              {review}
%    }
%\end{verbatim}
%
%    It should be pretty obvious that each line specifies the formatting
%    for a particular field. After reading the data for a particular
%    \cn{bib} command, \latex/ steps through the style specification and
%    for each
%    field listed, prints the field with the given formatting \emph{if
%    and only if the field has a nonempty value}. The \verb'+' character
%    at the beginning of each field specification must be followed by three
%    arguments: the punctuation to be added if the field is nonempty;
%    space and/or other material to be added after the punctuation; and
%    the field name. It is permissible for the second part to end with a
%    command that takes an argument, such as \cn{textbf}, in which case
%    it will receive the field's value as its argument. By defining a
%    suitable command and using it here you can place material after the
%    field contents as well as before; \cn{parenthesize} is an example
%    of this.
%
%    The reason that the punctuation and the following space are specified
%    separately is that between them there is a crucial boundary for line
%    breaks. If you put a \cn{linebreak} command at the end of a field value,
%    the break point will actually be carried onward to a suitable point after
%    the next bit of punctuation (whose actual value may vary depending on
%    which of the following fields is the first to turn up with a nonempty
%    value).
%
%    The meaning of the \cn{parenthesize} command, supplied by
%    \pkg{amsrefs}, should be obvious. The meaning of the \cn{PrintAuthors}
%    command is a different story. But I don't think it is all that hard to
%    understand. If we have two or more author names which were given
%    separately,
%    and we need to combine them into a conventional name list using commas
%    and the word \qq{and}, then it would be nice if we had a command which
%    could take a list of names and Do The Right Thing. And that is just
%    what \cn{PrintAuthors} is.
%
%    The \pkg{rkeyval} package allows keys to be defined as additive: if the
%    key occurs more than once, each successive value will be concatenated to
%    the previous value, along with a prefix. The setup done by
%    \pkg{amsrefs} for the \fld{author} field is
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \DefineAdditiveKey{bib}{author}{\name}
%\end{verbatim}
%    This means that if two names are given, as in
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    author={Bertram, A.},
%    author={Wentworth, R.},
%\end{verbatim}
%    then the final value of the \fld{author} field seen when \latex/
%    processes the style specification will be
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \name{Bertram, A.}\name{Wentworth, R.}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%    The \fld{transition} field in our \cn{BibSpec} example is a dummy
%    field to be
%    used when punctuation or other material must be added at a certain point
%    in the bibliography without regard to the emptiness or non-emptiness of
%    the fields after it. The \fld{transition} field always tests as non-empty
%    but has no printed content. So when you use it you always get the
%    indicated punctuation and space at the indicated point in the list of
%    fields. If it were the last thing in this \cn{BibSpec} example, it could
%    serve just to put in the final period that is always wanted. But in AMS
%    bibliographies, if a \emph{Mathematical Reviews} reference is given, it is
%    conventionally printed \emph{after} the final period. Using the
%    \fld{transition} field as shown here ensures that the final period will
%    be always printed, even when the \fld{review} field is empty.
%
% \section{Miscellaneous commands provided by the \pkg{amsrefs}
%    package}\label{misc-cmds}
%
%    Most of the following commands are helper commands for use in
%    \cn{BibSpec} statements. The others are intended for use in bibliography
%    data.
%    \begin{description}
%
%    \item[\cn{parenthesize}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\parenthesize}
%    This command adds parentheses around its
%      argument. It is useful in \cn{BibSpec} statements because there is no
%      special provision for adding material after the field value.
%
%    \item[\cn{bibquotes}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\bibquotes}
%    This command is much like \cn{parenthesize} but
%      it adds quotes around its argument and it has one other important
%      difference: there are special arrangements to print the closing quote
%      \emph{after} a following comma or similar punctuation (unless the
%      \pkg{amsrefs} package is invoked with the \opt{logical-quotes} option,
%      in which case \cn{bibquotes} puts the closing quote immediately after
%      the quoted material).
%
%    \item[\cn{voltext}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\voltext}
%    This is used to format volume numbers.  By default, it precedes
%    the volume number by ``vol.''
%
%    \item[\cn{issuetext}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\issuetext}
%    This is used to format issue numbers.  By default, it precedes
%    the volume number by ``no.''
%
%    \item[\cn{editiontext}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\editiontext}
%    This command produces ``ed.''\ following an
%      edition number. See \cn{PrintEdition} for more information.
%
%    \item[\cn{DashPages}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\DashPages}
%    This command is similar in spirit to
%    \cn{voltext} but more complicated in its implementation. It takes
%    one argument which is expected to contain one or more page numbers
%    or a range of page numbers. The argument is printed with a prefix
%    of \qq{p.} if it seems to be a single page number, otherwise with a
%    prefix of \qq{pp.}.
%
%    \item[\cn{tsup}, \cn{tsub}, \cn{tprime}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\tsup}
%    \SpecialUsageIndex{\tsub}\SpecialUsageIndex{\prime}
%    These are for text subscripts
%      and superscripts, with \cn{tprime} producing a superscript prime
%      symbol. Unlike the standard \cn{textsuperscript} and
%      \cn{textsubscript} functions provided by \latex/, these do not use
%      math mode at all.\footnote{There is one drawback: If you don't
%      want to get the prime symbol for \cn{tprime} from the \fnt{cmsy}
%      font, you will need to redefine \cn{tprime} in some suitable
%      way.}
%
%    \item[\cn{nopunct}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\nopunct}
%    This command causes following punctuation to be omitted if it is
%    added with the internal function \cs{@addpunct}.
%
%    \item[\cn{PrintPrimary}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\PrintPrimary}
%    This is a relatively complicated function that determines the
%    ``primary'' contributors for an entry and formats them, or
%    replaces them by \cn{sameauthors} if appropriate.  It should be
%    used when an entry type might have editors or translators instead
%    of authors.  It prefers authors over editors and editors over
%    translators and generates a warning if there are no primary
%    contributors.
%
%    \item[\cn{PrintAuthors}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\PrintAuthors}
%    This is used to format the list of authors as the primary
%    contributors for an entry type.
%
%    \item[\cn{PrintEditorsA}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\PrintEditorsA}
%    This is similar to \cn{PrintAuthors} but adds |(ed.)| or |(eds.)|
%    following the editors.
%
%    \item[\cn{PrintEditorsB}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\PrintEditorsB}
%    This is similar to \cn{PrintEditorsA} but puts parentheses around
%    the entire list of editors.  It's used by, for example, the
%    \btype{article} type to print the editors of a
%    \btype{proceedings} or \btype{collection}.
%
%    \item[\cn{PrintEditorsC}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\PrintEditorsC}
%    Similar to \cn{PrintEditorsA} but precedes the editors by
%    |Edited by|.  It's used when the editors should be treated as
%    subsidiary contributors, rather than the primary contributor.
%
%    \item[\cn{PrintTranslatorsA}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\PrintTranslatorsA}
%    This is similar to \cn{PrintEditorsA} but adds |(trans.)|
%    following the translators.
%
%    \item[\cn{PrintTranslatorsB}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\PrintTranslatorsB}
%    This is similar to \cn{PrintEditorsB}.  It's not currently used,
%    but is provided for symmetry.
%
%    \item[\cn{PrintTranslatorsC}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\PrintTranslatorsC}
%    Similar to \cn{PrintEditorsC} but precedes the translators by
%    |Translated by|.
%
%    \item[\cn{sameauthors}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\sameauthors}
%    This is a function of one argument. If you use
%      the default set of \cn{BibSpec}s from the \pkg{amsrefs},
%      \cn{sameauthors} is applied to the author name for a given \cn{bib}
%      command if it matches exactly the author name of the preceding
%      \cn{bib} command. Change the definition of \cn{sameauthors} if you
%      don't want to get a bysame dash.
%
%    \item[\cn{bysame}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\bysame}
%    This is a horizontal rule of length 3~em. The default
%      definition of \cn{sameauthors} prints \cn{bysame} instead of the
%      author names.
%
%    \item[\cn{Plural}, \cn{SingularPlural}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\Plural}
%    \SpecialUsageIndex{\SingularPlural}
%    These are helper functions
%      that allow you to conditionally
%      print singular or plural forms such as \verb'(ed.)' or \verb'(eds.)'
%      depending on the number of names in the current name list.
%      The definition of \cn{PrintEditorsA} reads, in part,
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    ... (ed\Plural{s}.) ...
%\end{verbatim}
%
%    \item[\cn{PrintReviews}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\PrintReviews}
%    This is similar to \cn{AuthorList} but is used for
%      printing (possibly multiple) MR numbers given in the \fld{review}
%      field.
%
%    \item[\cn{BibField}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\BibField}
%    This is for more complicated programming tasks such
%    as may be necessary for some \cn{BibSpec}s.  It takes one
%    argument, a field name, and yields the contents of that field for
%    the current \cn{bib} entry.
%
%    \item[\cn{IfEmptyBibField}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\IfEmptyBibField}
%    If one writes
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \IfEmptyBibField{isbn}{A}{B}
%\end{verbatim}
%    then the commands in A will be executed if the \fld{isbn} field is empty,
%    otherwise the commands in B.
%
%    \item[\cn{PrintEdition}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\PrintEdition}
%    If a bibliography entry has
%    \begin{verbatim}
%      edition={2}
%\end{verbatim}
%    and the \cn{BibSpec} used \cn{PrintEdition} to handle this field, then the
%    edition information will be printed as \qq{2nd ed.}\mdash that is, the
%    number is converted to cardinal form and \qq{ed.} is added (taken from
%    \cn{editiontext}).
%
%    \item[\cn{CardinalNumeric}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\CardinalNumeric}
%    This provides the conversion to cardinal
%      number form used by \cn{PrintEdition}.
%
%    \item[\cn{PrintDate}, \cn{PrintYear}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\PrintDate}
%    \SpecialUsageIndex{\PrintYear}
%    These functions convert a date in
%      canonical form (ISO 8601) to the form required by the current
%      bibliography style.  You can get your preferred date form by
%      redefining these functions or by changing your \cn{BibSpec} statements
%      to use another function of your own devising. The original definition
%      of \cn{PrintDate} adds parentheses (as for the year of a journal article
%      in normal AMS style), whereas the \cn{PrintYear} function simply
%      prints the year without any additional material (as for a book's year
%      of publication in normal AMS style).
%
%    \item[\cn{mdash}, \cn{ndash}]\SpecialUsageIndex{\mdash}
%    \SpecialUsageIndex{\ndash}
%      These are short forms for \cn{textemdash}
%      and \cn{textendash}, recommended instead of the more usual \verb'---'
%      and \verb'--' notation. From the \pkg{textcmds} package.
%

% \section{Implementation}
%
% \subsection{Overview}
%
%    It will be a while yet before we get to any actual code. First we
%    need to understand what the code needs to accomplish in order to
%    provide the user interface described above in a way that is as
%    compatible as possible with existing \latex/ mechanisms.
%
% \subsubsection{Normal \latex/ processing of cites}
%
% \paragraph{First \latex/ pass}
%
%    Various commands are written to the \fn{.aux} file that are
%    mostly used by \bibtex/.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item A \cnm{cite}{moo} command writes one line to the \fn{.aux} file:
%    \cnm{citation}{moo}. This indicates to \bibtex/ that it should
%    include `moo' in the list of cited items to be searched for.
%    The \cn{cite} command also checks to see if \cs{b@moo} contains
%    the corresponding citation label, but since this is the first
%    pass, the label won't be known yet, so \latex/ emits an `Undefined
%    citation' warning and prints a placeholder (i.e., \textbf{???})
%    instead of the citation label.
%
% \item A \cnm{bibliographystyle}{har} command writes one line to the
%    \fn{.aux} file: \cnm{bibstyle}{har}. This indicates to \bibtex/ that it
%    should use \fn{har.bst} to determine the style for sorting and
%    formatting the bibliography items.
%
% \item A \cnm{bibliography}{hij,klm,...} command writes one line to the
%    \fn{.aux} file: \cnm{bibdata}{hij,klm,...}. This indicates to \bibtex/
%    that it should look in \fn{hij.bib}, \fn{klm.bib}, \dots\ for
%    bibliographic data. The \cn{bibliography} also tries to input
%    the \fn{.bbl} file, but on the first pass it won't exist
%    yet.
%
% \end{enumerate}
%
%    On the first pass all \cn{cite}'s normally are reported as
%    undefined because the \fn{.bbl} file has not yet been created.
%
% \paragraph{\bibtex/ pass}
%
%    For a document named \fn{xyz.tex}, the command \verb'bibtex xyz' is
%    used to invoke \bibtex/. It looks in \fn{xyz.aux} to find the
%    citation information written there by \latex/. For each \cn{citation} line,
%    \bibtex/ searches for a corresponding entry in the specified
%    \fn{.bib} files and formats it. The entire list is then sorted in
%    whatever way dictated by the bibliography style, and written out to
%    the file \fn{xyz.bbl}. This normally produces entries that look
%    something like:
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \bibitem{BGL} P. Busch, M. Grabowski and P. J. Lahti:
%    {\it Operational Quantum Physics.}
%    Springer Verlag, New York (1995).
%\end{verbatim}
%
% \paragraph{Second \latex/ pass}
%
%    Now the \fn{.bbl} file exists and contains some \cn{bibitem}
%    commands. At \cnm{begin}{document}, \latex/ reads the \fn{.aux} file,
%    hoping to find some \cn{bibcite} commands, but it will not find
%    them until the next time around. \cn{citation}, \cn{bibstyle}, and
%    \cn{bibdata} commands in the \fn{.aux} file are simply ignored by \latex/.
%    Then \latex/ proceeds to typeset the body of the document.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Instances of \cn{cite} still print question marks.
%
% \item The \cn{bibliography} command causes \latex/ to input \fn{xyz.bbl}
%    and typeset its contents.
%
% \item A \cnm{bibitem}{moo} command writes one line to the
%    \fn{.aux} file: \cnmm{bibcite}{moo}{9}, where 9 is the current item
%    number.
%
% \item A \cnom{bibitem}[Moody]{moo} command writes one line to the
%    \fn{.aux} file: \cnmm{bibcite}{moo}{Moody}, using the supplied label
%    instead of a number.
%
% \end{enumerate}
%
% \paragraph{Third \latex/ pass}
%
%    Now the \fn{.aux} file contains some \cn{bibcite} commands. Once again,
%    \latex/ reads the \fn{.aux} file when it reaches \cnm{begin}{document}.
% \begin{enumerate}
%
% \item A \cnmm{bibcite}{moo}{Moody} causes \latex/ to define \cs{b@moo}
%    with `Moody' as the replacement text.
%
% \item If two \cn{bibcite} commands have the same citation key, \latex/
%    gives a warning message. This happens at \cnm{begin}{document},
%    during the reading of the \fn{.aux} file.
%
% \item Instances of \cn{cite} in the body of the document will print
%    the appropriate labels obtained from the \fn{.aux} file.
%
% \item If there are any \cn{cite} commands for which the \fn{.aux} file did
%    not have a \cn{bibcite} command, \latex/ will give an `Undefined
%    citation' warning. This often happens if the \fn{.aux} file is incomplete
%    due to a \TeX{} error on the preceding pass.
% \end{enumerate}
%
% \subsection{How cites are processed by \pkg{amsrefs}}
%
%    In order to support its additional features (e.g., author-year
%    citations and the \opt{backrefs} option), the \rpack/ stores additional
%    information for each cite in the macro \cs{b@whatever}. Instead of
%    simply using the defined or undefined status of this macro to
%    trigger the standard warnings, we add some boolean flags to allow
%    us to discriminate more finely what the current situation is.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Each time an item is cited in the body of the document, a
%    \texttt{backref} entry is added to the info of that item. The
%    \texttt{backref} info
%    is the current page and section location. Section location is a bit
%    hard to get right without better support from the document class.
%    So we provide a hook to allow it to work better when the support is
%    there.
%
% \item When a cite occurs, if the info is undefined then a warning is
%    issued and the info structure is created. A \cs{citation} command
%    and a \cs{citedest} command (providing backref info) are written to
%    the \fn{.aux} file. Because the backref info includes page number, it has
%    to be a non-immediate write.
%
%    An undefined info structure would normally happen only on a first
%    pass when no \fn{.aux} file exists, or when a new cite is added.
%    I.e., when the corresponding \cs{citation} command is not yet
%    present in the \fn{.aux} file.
%
% \item When a citation command occurs in the \fn{.aux} file, it initializes
%    the info structure if necessary, setting the ``bib-info-present''
%    flag to 0.
%
% \item When a \cs{citedest} command occurs in the \fn{.aux} file, it
%    initializes the info structure if necessary---but this shouldn't
%    happen: if the corresponding \cs{citation} command did not already
%    get processed, then something is wrong. So normally, the
%    \cs{citedest} command merely needs to add its backref info to the
%    existing info structure.
%
% \item When a \cs{bibcite} command occurs in the \fn{.aux} file, it will
%    normally find that \cs{b@whatever} is already defined, if the
%    bibliography occurs after all the \cn{cite} commands. What it must
%    do is fill in the appropriate blank slots in the info structure
%    set up by a previous \cs{citation} command.
%
% \item The \fn{.aux} file is actually processed two times, once at the
%    beginning of the document and once at the end. In the latter case,
%    \cs{bibcite} should give a warning if the backref-list is empty,
%    since that means there were no \cn{cite} commands for the given
%    key.
%
% \item When processing the bibliography: The \cn{bib} command needs to
%    check if it is using a key that is already used by another \cn{bib}
%    command.
% \end{itemize}
%
%    We therefore have
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \b@xyz -> \citesel 00{label}{year}{backref-list}
%\end{verbatim}
%    where the first~0 is replaced by~1 if there has already been another
%    citation for the same key earlier in the document (some citation
%    styles use abbreviated forms for all instances after the first),
%    and the second~0 is replaced by~1 if the same key was already
%    used by an earlier \cn{bib} command.
%
%    Because the backref-list often includes page number information, it
%    cannot be built on the fly as we go along; instead we have to write
%    the information to the \fn{.aux} file and read it in at the beginning of
%    the next run.
%
%    If there was no \cs{bibcite} in the \fn{.aux} file for a given key, then
%    the info is
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \b@xyz -> \citesel 00{}{}{backref-list}
%\end{verbatim}
%    If there was neither \cs{citation} nor \cs{bibcite} in the \fn{.aux} file
%    for a given key, then the \cn{cite} command should find that
%    \ncn{b@xyz} is undefined.
%
%    If the author-year option is in effect, the \qq{label} contains
%    the author last names instead of a label:
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \b@xyz -> \citesel 00{\name{Smith}\name{Jones}}{...}{...}
%\end{verbatim}
%    Full name information is included in the data because some citation
%    styles give full names at the first citation and abbreviated forms
%    for subsequent instances.
%
% \subsection{Data structures}
%
%    The result of scanning the key/value pairs of a \cn{bib} command is
%    an assignment statement for \cs{rsk@toks}. (Cf.\@ the \pkg{rkeyval}
%    package.) For example, consider the entry
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \bib{miller83}{article}{
%      author={Miller, G.},
%      title={Eine Bemerkung zur Darstellung von Polynomen \"{u}ber
%        Verb\"{a}nden}*{language={german}},
%      journal={J. Math. Sent.},
%      volume={10},
%      year={1983},
%      pages={26\ndash 30},
%    }
%\end{verbatim}
%    The scanned result is to assign
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \global\rsk@toks{%
%       \set:bib'author{Miller, G.}{}%
%       \set:bib'title{Eine Bemerkung zur Darstellung von Polynomen
%           \"{u}ber Verb\"{a}nden}{language={german}}%
%       \set:bib'journal{J. Math. Sent.}{}%
%       \set:bib'volume{10}{}%
%       \set:bib'year{1983}{}%
%       \set:bib'pages{26\ndash 30}{}%
%    }
%\end{verbatim}
%    The code in the last arg of \cn{RestrictedSetKeys} then invokes
%    \cs{bib@exec} to do something with the value of \cs{rsk@toks}.
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \bib@exec{miller83}{\the\rsk@toks}{\setbib@article}{}
%\end{verbatim}

% \subsection{Utilities}
%
%    Some of these useful functions are also found in AMS
%    document classes.
%
%    \begin{macro}{\after@deleting@token}
%    Similar in concept to \cs{afterassignment}, except it deletes the
%    next token in the stream before putting its argument
%    back into the input.  Useful for skipping past tokens during
%    parsing.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\after@deleting@token#1{%
    \afterassignment#1%
    \let\@let@token= % Don't delete this space!
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{macro}
%
%    \begin{macro}{\@ifempty}
%    \begin{macro}{\@ifnotempty}
%    Some frequently used tests for empty arguments.  Note that an
%    argument consisting entirely of spaces (e.g.,
%    \verb*|\@ifempty{ }|) counts as empty.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\long\def\@ifempty#1{\@xifempty#1@@..\@nil}

\long\def\@xifempty#1#2@#3#4#5\@nil{%

%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{macro}
%
%    \begin{macro}{\auto@protect}
%    Sometimes it's convenient to render a given control sequence
%    unexpandable for a time.  \cs{auto@protect} provides a way to do
%    that.\footnote{There really should be a special name for macros
%    that, like \cs{auto@protect}, take a control sequence as an
%    argument and redefine that control sequence in order to achieve
%    some special effect.  Pending happier inspiration, I'm
%    going to call them ``wrapper'' macros.\index{wrapper macros,
%    definition}}
%
%    An earlier version of this code read simply |\let#1\relax| but
%    that had the disadvantage of making all \cs{auto@protect}ed
%    macros compare equal via \cs{ifx}.  This version allows macros to
%    keep their identities under comparisons.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\auto@protect#1{\def#1{\@nx#1}}

%    \begin{macro}{\g@undef}
%    Globally undefine a control sequence.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\g@undef#1{\global\let#1\relax}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{macro}

%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\add@toks@{\addto@hook\toks@}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{macro}
%
%    \begin{macro}{\@lappend}
%    Append an element to a \cs{do}-delimited list.  As long as the
%    element to be appended (|#2|) is a single token, nothing is
%    expanded.  If it contains multiple tokens, all tokens after the
%    first will be expanded.

%
%    \begin{macro}{\get@numberof}
%    This is a generic macro for counting the number of elements in a
%    \latex/-style list.
%    The first argument is a \cs{count} register that will receive the
%    final count; the second argument is the control sequence that
%    separates elements of the list, and the third argument is the
%    list itself.  So, for example,
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \get@numberof\@tempcnta\do\dospecials
%\end{verbatim}
%    would count the number of special characters in \cs{dospecials}
%    and store the number in \cs{@tempcnta}.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\get@numberof#1#2#3{%

    \@tempb
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{macro}
%
%    \begin{macro}{\safe@set}
%    This is a quick and dirty way of extracting an integer prefix
%    from a string and assigning it to a counter.  If the string does
%    not begin with an integer, the counter receives the value~0.  The
%    suffix after the integer prefix is discarded.  (But bad things
%    will happen if the string contains the token \cs{@nil}.)

\def\safe@set#1#2{%

}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{macro}
%
%    \begin{macro}{\@chomp}
%    Vaguely reminiscent of Perl's \texttt{chomp} function, which removes
%    a substring from the end of a variable, but ours works with
%    tokens (more-or-less) and takes the substring to be removed as
%    its second argument.  Note the use of \cs{@empty} to anchor the
%    chomped substring to the end of the string.  Note also that the
%    second argument will be fully expanded during the chomping.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\@chomp#1#2{%

    \@tempa
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{macro}
%
%    \begin{macro}{\chomp@}
%    Before passing control to \cs{@chomper}, we peek ahead at the
%    next token in the stream.  That way, if the next token is an open
%    brace, we know we need to surround \cs{@chomper}'s first argument
%    with braces.  Unfortunately, this might still remove braces from
%    the second argument, but I think that's ok for our purposes.

% \subsection{Declaring package options}
%
%    We call the \pkg{ifoption} package to facilitate some option tests.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\RequirePackage{ifoption}[2000/02/15]
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%    The \opt{sorted} option is a no-op and is no longer documented.
%    I'm only leaving it here for backwards compatibility.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareExclusiveOptions{sorted,citation-order}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    The \opt{alphabetic} option corresponds to the standard \bst{alpha}
%    biblio style with labels like Knu66 (three letters from name plus
%    two digits of year). Maybe should provide an alias LllYY for this
%    option. Numeric is the default since it is commoner in AMS
%    publications.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareExclusiveOptions{alphabetic,shortalphabetic,author-year,numeric}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%    \begin{option}{y2k}
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareBooleanOption{y2k}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{option}
%
%    \begin{option}{nobysame}
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareBooleanOption{nobysame}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{option}
%
%    The standard \bst{abbrv} bibliography style uses abbreviations for
%    month names and journal names, and first names of people are
%    abbreviated to their initials. Since the second test bibliography
%    that I tested with had unabbreviated month names but abbreviated
%    journal names, perhaps it is a good idea to let these choices be
%    specified separately.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareBooleanOption{short-journals}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareBooleanOption{short-publishers}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    The \opt{short-journals} and \opt{short-publishers} options only
%    affect journal and publisher names that are defined with
%    \cn{DefineJournal} and \cn{DefinePublisher} commands.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareBooleanOption{short-months}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareBooleanOption{initials}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Nevertheless, it's to be expected that the preceding four options
%    would typically be used together, so we provide a short-hand for
%    requesting them all.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareOption{abbrev}{%
    \@pass@ptions
        \@currext
        {initials,short-months,short-journals,short-publishers}%
        \@currname
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%    In the bibliography, if a title or something is enclosed in quotes,
%    should the closing quotes go inside the punctuation (logical
%    position) rather than outside (traditional)? These options give you
%    a choice.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareExclusiveOptions{traditional-quotes,logical-quotes}
%    \end{macrocode}
%
%    A sequence of cites will be sorted and ranges of length three or
%    greater will be compressed if these options so indicate.  Note
%    that the \opt{non-sorted-cites} option automatically disables
%    compression.  This is probably a feature.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareExclusiveOptions{sorted-cites,non-sorted-cites}
\DeclareExclusiveOptions{non-compressed-cites,compressed-cites}

%    reads the field specification is
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    #1={punctuation} #2={prelim material} #3={field name} #4=+
%\end{verbatim}
%    where the fourth argument is actually expected to be either the
%    |+| from the following specification, or one of the special
%    \cs{@empty} tokens inserted by \cs{BibSpec}.  If it is neither of
%    these special values, it means we have a malformed specification;

%    The function \cs{bib@append} prints the value of a field, together

%    punctuation, and possibly a function to be applied to the contents
%    of arg 3, which is
%    a macro containing the field
%    value. So if we have \cn{moo} and \cn{bib'pages}, from
%    \verb'pages={21\ndash 44}', then we want to arrange to call
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \moo{21\ndash 44}

%
%    \begin{macro}{\erase@field}
%    There are some fields that can appear in more than one place in a
%    reference, depending on context.  For example, if a book has an
%    editor but no author, the editor appears at the beginning of the
%    entry, but if the book has both an editor and an author, the
%    editor appears at the end of the entry. A simple way to handle
%    this is to ``erase'' the \fld{editor} field after printing it,
%    which is what \cs{erase@field} is for.
%
%    The obvious definition of \cs{erase@field} is
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \def\erase@field#1{\global\let#1\@empty}
%\end{verbatim}
%    but that doesn't work because the top-level value of
%    \pkg{rkeyval} fields isn't \cs{@empty}; instead, it contains a
%    setter function used by \cs{RestrictedSetKeys} when processing a
%    key-value list (see \cs{rkv@DSAK}, \cs{rsk@set@a} and
%    \cs{rsk@set@b}).
%
%    On the other hand, rewriting the field locally won't work
%    either, since \cs{erase@field} will typically be executed inside
%    the group established by \cs{bib@append}.  Instead, we want to
%    rewrite the value right after \cs{bib@append}'s group ends.  One
%    way to do this would be to keep a list of fields to be erased and
%    have \cs{bib@append} iterate over the list after its
%    \ncn{endgroup}.
%
%    However, as long as the call to \cs{erase@field}
%    is never nested within any deeper groups, it's simpler just to
%    use \cs{aftergroup}, which is what we'll do (``Sufficient unto
%    the day is the evil thereof'' and all that).
%    \begin{macrocode}

% \subsection{Processing bibliography entries}
%
%    There are several things one might want to do when a \cn{bib} entry
%    is encountered:
%    \begin{enumerate}
%
%    \item Format and print it.  This corresponds to the direct entry
%    of bibliography items as described in section~2.1 of the users's
%    guide.
%
%    \item Copy it into a \fn{.bbl} file.  This corresponds to the use
%    of \cn{bibselect} and an external \fn{.ltb} database as described
%    in section~2.2 of the user's guide.
%
%    \item Store the full information in memory.  This is done by
%    \cn{bib*}.
%
%    \end{enumerate}

% \subsection{Citation processing}
%
% \subsubsection{The \cs{citesel} structure}
%
%    The information used by \cn{cite} for key \texttt{moo} is stored in
%    \cs{b@moo} in the form
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \citesel{status1}{status2}{label}{year}{backref-info}
%\end{verbatim}%
%
%    The first status flag is~1 if this key has already been cited
%    earlier in the same document; 0~otherwise. This is used in some
%    bibliography schemes to print a full list of author names for the first
%    citation and an abbreviated author list for subsequent citations.
%
%    The second status flag is~1 if this key has already been used by a
%    define-cite command (such as \cn{bib}); 0~otherwise. This makes it
%    possible to issue a warning message as soon as the conflict is seen,
%    on the first \latex/ run, instead of on a subsequent run during the
%    processing of the \fn{.aux} file.
%
%    When an author/year citation scheme is in use, args 3 and~4 hold
%    respectively author names and year. Otherwise arg~3 simply holds
%    a cite label and arg~4 is empty.
%
%    And finally, arg~5 holds a list of backref pointers indicating the
%    locations in the document where this entry has been cited.

% \subsubsection{The basic \cn{cite} command}
%
%    Here is the difference between the various optional forms of
%    \cn{cite}:
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \cite{xyz}        -> \cite@a\citesel{xyz}{}
%                      -> \cite@bc\b@xyz\citesel{}
%
%    \cite{xyz}*{blub} -> \cite@a\citesel{xyz}{blub}
%                      -> \cite@bc\b@xyz\citesel{blub}
%
%    \cite[blub]{xyz}  -> \cite@a\citesel{xyz}{blub}
%                      -> \cite@bc\b@xyz\citesel{blub}
%\end{verbatim}

% \subsubsection{Range compression}
%
%    When the time comes to apply compression, we have at our disposal a
%    list of internal cite calls that looks like this:
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \cite@cj\b@aaa{opta}\cite@cj\b@bbb{optb}...\cite@cj\b@zzz{optz}
%\end{verbatim}
%    where
%    \[ \ncn{b@aaa} < \ncn{b@bbb} < \cdots < \ncn{b@zzz} \]
%    and the \texttt{opt} arguments are possibly null.
%    To print the citations while collapsing sequences of 3 or more
%    contiguous numbers into ranges of the form $n$--$m$, we bind
%    \cs{cite@cj} to a suitably clever function and then execute the
%    list.  In the absence of optional arguments, here's the algorithm:
%
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item[Begin.]
%    Enter state~0.  This is done by \cs{cite@sorted@s}.
% \item[State 0.]
%^^A    This is the initial state.
%    The current citation is the beginning
%    of a range (possibly a singleton range).  Print it.  Then, set
%    $\mathit{prevnum} := \mathit{number}$ and enter state~1.
%
% \item[State 1.]
%    The current citation might be the second element of a range.
%    \begin{enumerate}
%    \item[Case a)]
%    $\mathit{number} = \mathit{prevnum} + 1$. Then the current
%    item is definitely the second element of a range.  It might be
%    the last element of the range, but we won't know until we examine
%    the following citation.  So, save the current citation in
%    \cs{prev@cite}, set $\mathit{prevnum} := \mathit{number}$, and go
%    to state~2.
%
%    \item[Case b)]
%    $\mathit{number} \ne \mathit{prevnum} + 1$.  The current citation
%    is the beginning of a new range.  Print it, set
%    $\mathit{prevnum} := \mathit{number}$ and remain in state~1.
%    (This is essentially identical to stage~0.)
%
%    \end{enumerate}
%
% \item[State 2.]\leavevmode
%    The current citation might be the third (or later) element of a
%    range.
%    \begin{enumerate}
%   \item[Case a)]
%    $\mathit{number} = \mathit{prevnum} + 1$.  The current element is
%    definitely part of a range.  It might be the last
%    element of the range, but again we won't know until we examine
%    the following citation.  Save the current citation
%    in \cs{prev@cite} and set $\mathit{prevnum} := \mathit{number}$.
%    Remain in state~2.
%
% \item[Case b)]
%    $\mathit{number} \ne \mathit{prevnum} + 1$.  The previous
%    citation was the end of a range and the current citation is the
%    beginning of a new range.  Print a dash followed by
%    \cs{prev@cite}, then set $\mathit{prevnum} := \mathit{number}$
%    and enter state~1.
%
%    \end{enumerate}
%
% \item[End.] If \cs{prev@cite} is not empty, print it, preceded by a
%    dash if we were in the middle of a range.  (This is done by
%    \cs{cite@sorted@e}.)
%
% \end{enumerate}
%
%    The presence of optional arguments complicates things
%    somewhat, since a citation with an optional argument should never
%    participate in range compression.  In other words, when we come
%    across an optional argument, we should finish off the preceding
%    range, print the current citation, and then return to the initial
%    state.  More precisely, here are the actions taken in each state
%    when there is an optional argument:
%
%    \begin{enumerate}
%
%    \item[State 0.]
%    Print the current citation and remain in state~0.
%
%    \item[State 1.]
%    Print the current citation and return to state~0.
%
%    \item[State 2.]
%    Print a dash followed by \cs{prev@cite}.  Then print the current
%    citation and return to state~0.
%
%    \end{enumerate}

%
%    \begin{macro}{\prev@cite@cb}
%    There's one further complication: Even though we're suppressing
%    some of the citation numbers, we need to make sure that each
%    citation is recorded in the \fn{.aux} file.  So, in case~2a,
%    before we overwrite \cs{prev@cite}, we first invoke
%    \cs{prev@cite@cb} to record the previous citation (if any).
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\prev@cite@cb{%
    \ifx\@prev@cite\@empty

%    Ok, I lied.  There was more than one further complication.
%    Suppose that when we hit the end of the list, we're in state~2.
%    We need to know whether to output a dash or a comma.  (For
%    example, both the sequences $[2, 3]$ and $[1, 2, 3]$ will end in
%    state~2 with $\mathit{prevcite} = 3$, but in the former case we
%    want a comma before the~3 and in the latter case we want a dash.)
%    So, rather than printing the dash explicitly, we use
%    \cs{cite@dash} to keep track of whether a dash is needed.

%    State 0, 1 and~2 each correspond to a different binding for

% \subsection{Lexical structure of names}
%
%    Before we can begin parsing names, we need to give some thought
%    to the lexical structure of names.  For the remainder of this
%    document, when we refer to a ``name'' and especially when we
%    speak of a name as a macro argument, we assume that the only
%    tokens contained in the name are
%    \begin{itemize}
%
%    \item
%    letters and punctuation (i.e., characters with catcode 11 or~12),
%
%    \item
%    ties (the token |~|$_{13}$),
%
%    \item
%    accent commands, such as |\"| or |\k|,
%
%    \item
%    text symbol macros, such as |\i|, |\ae| or |\cprime|,
%
%    \item
%    grouping characters (braces).
%
%    \end{itemize}
%
%    In addition to their normal function of delimiting macro
%    arguments, braces inside names have the following special
%    functions:
%    \begin{enumerate}
%
%    \item They are used to indicate that multiple characters should
%    be considered a single ``compound'' character when extracting
%    initials.  For example, |Yuri| becomes |Y.|, but |{Yu}ri| becomes
%    |Yu.|
%
%    \label{initial-braces}
%    An important aspect of this use of braces is that it only applies
%    to the first characters of a given name.  As we'll see below,
%    this has important implications for our parsing code, which must
%    preserve braces at the beginning of given names, but can be more
%    cavalier with braces in other positions.
%
%    \item
%    Spaces and commas are ordinarily interpreted as name separators,
%    rather than name components.  Similarly, periods and hyphens
%    usually have a special interpretation.  All these characters can
%    be stripped of their special meanings by putting them within
%    braces.
%
%    \end{enumerate}
%
%    In practice, it might be possible to insert other tokens (such as
%    macros) into names as long as they either (a)~are non-expandable
%    or (b)~expand into a series of tokens of the above enumerated
%    types.  However, in such cases it will probably be safer to
%    declare the macro in question as either a text accent or a text
%    symbol.
%
% \subsubsection{Text accents}
%
%    Syntactically, a text accent is a macro that takes a single,
%    undelimited argument, i.e, it has a ``prototype'' of
%    |macro:#1->|.  Semantically, the implication is that it takes a
%    letter (the \emph{base}) as an argument and produces a glyph that
%    for certain purposes can be considered equivalent to the
%    base (see the discussion of stem comparison on
%    page~\pageref{stem-comparison}).\footnote{Note that this is meant
%    to be a pragmatic definition for the purposes of this package.
%    No claim is made to greater generality.}
%
%    \begin{macro}{\amsrefs@textaccents}
%    This will contain a list of accent commands in standard \LaTeX\
%    format (i.e., separated by the token \cs{do}).  For example,
%    after registering the \cn{"} and \cn{'} accents, it will contain
%    \begin{verbatim}
%        \do \"\do \'
%\end{verbatim}
%    \begin{macrocode}
\let\amsrefs@textaccents\@empty
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{macro}

\def\DeclareNameAccent{%
    \@lappend\amsrefs@textaccents

%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{macro}
%
%    Here are all the standard \LaTeX\ accents, as well as a few
%    nonstandard accents from the \pkg{mathscinet} package.

%    look at them in the right light.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\DeclareNameAccent\etalchar
%\DeclareNameAccent\etaltext
%    \end{macrocode}
%
% \subsubsection{Text symbols}
%
%    Syntactically, a text symbol is a macro with a empty parameter
%    text, i.e., a prototype of |macro:->|.  Semantically, it's a
%    letter-like glyph that should not be considered equivalent
%    to any other glyph or group of glyphs.  In addition, it may exist
%    in both upper- and lowercase variants, unlike text accents, where
%    we consider the case to be an attribute of the base letter, not
%    of the accent.\footnote{As with text accents, this is not
%    intended as a fully general definition.}
%
%    \begin{macro}{\amsrefs@textsymbols}
%    This is analogous to \cs{amsrefs@textaccents} but a little more
%    complicated due to the need to store lowercase equivalents. It
%    consists of a list of double entries of the form
%    \begin{verbatim}
%        \do \symbol \do \lcsymbol
%\end{verbatim}
%    which means that \cs{symbol} is a text symbol whose corresponding
%    lowercase version is \cs{lcsymbol}.  (Note that nothing is
%    implied about whether \cs{symbol} is to be considered as
%    uppercase or lowercase.)  For example, in
%    \begin{verbatim}
%        \do \ae \do \ae \do \OE \do \oe
%\end{verbatim}
%    the first four tokens indicate that \cn{ae} is a text symbol with
%    lowercase equivalent \cn{ae}, while the last four tokens indicate
%    that \cn{OE} is a text symbol with lowercase equivalent \cn{oe}.
%    This scheme is somewhat redundant, but pleasingly simple.
%
%    This also duplicates some of the information in \cs{@uclclist},
%    but it seems safer to do this than to modify \cs{@uclclist}.

%    like text symbols, but semantically more like text accents.

%
% \subsubsection{\cs{edef}-like macros for names}
%    The following macros all behave sort of like \cs{edef}, in the
%    sense that
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \X@edef\foo{name}
%\end{verbatim}
%    defines \cs{foo} to be the result of expanding |name| and
%    applying a certain transformation to it.
%
%    \begin{macro}{\normalize@edef}
%    This converts accents in the name to a normalized form where the
%    accent and its argument are surrounded by braces.  E.g., after
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \normalize@edef\cs{P\'olya}
%\end{verbatim}
%    \cs{cs} will contain |P{\'o}lya|. (This might result in a
%    redundant layer of braces if the original text contained, say,
%    ``\verb+P{\'o}lya+'', but that's ok.)  This lets us extract the
%    first $n$ characters from a name by using \TeX's macro
%    argument-gobbling mechanism without worrying that an accent
%    will be separated from its base letter.
%    As a bonus, it also replaces ties (|~|) by spaces.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\normalize@edef#1#2{%
    \begingroup
        \@apply\auto@protect\amsrefs@textsymbols
        \@apply\wrap@accent\amsrefs@textaccents
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Redefine \cs{@tabacckludge} in case someone wants to use this
%    with the \pkg{inputenc} package.

    \@xp\endgroup
    \@tempa
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{macro}
%
%    \begin{macro}{\use@accent}
%    This is identical to \cs{@nameuse} except for the addition of the
%    \cs{string}, which, as per \fn{ltoutenc.dtx}, guards against the
%    eventuality that something like |'| might be active at the point
%    of use.  We don't expect to find a \cs{bib} in the middle of a
%    \env{tabbing} environment (do we?)\ so we
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\use@accent#1{\csname\string#1\endcsname}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{macro}
%
%    \begin{macro}{\wrap@accent}
%    Here's a wrapper macro that causes an accent to become
%    auto-wrapping.  E.g., after \verb+\wrap@accent\'+, \verb+\'o+
%    will expand to \verb+{\'o}+.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\wrap@accent#1{%
    \def#1##1{{\@nx#1##1}}%
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{macro}
%
%    \begin{macro}{\lc@edef}
%    This converts all the characters in a name to all lowercase,
%    using the mapping defined by \cs{amsrefs@textsymbols}.  So, after
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \lc@edef\cs{P\'olya}
%\end{verbatim}
%    \cs{cs} will contain |p\'olya|.  Note that accents are not
%    wrapped and ties are passed through unmolested.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\lc@edef#1#2{%

%
%    \begin{macro}{\lc@do}
%    This is a slighly more complicated wrapper macro than previous
%    ones.
%    The first argument is a text symbol; the second argument is the
%    lowercase variant of the symbol.  If they're the same (i.e., the
%    first argument is a lowercase text symbol), we \cs{auto@protect}
%    it.  Otherwise we define the first symbol to expand to the
%    second.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\lc@do#1\do#2{%
    \ifx#1#2%
        \auto@protect#1%

%    \end{macro}
%
%    \begin{macro}{\purge@edef}
%    Removes accents and braces from a name and converts ties to
%    spaces, leaving only letters, punctuation and text symbols.  For
%    example,
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \lc@edef\cs{P{\'o}lya}
%\end{verbatim}
%    will put |Polya| in~\cs{cs}.

%
% \subsection{Name parsing}
%
%    Parsing names is somewhat complicated because parts of the name
%    can (in principle) be empty (G=given, S=surname, J=jr)):
%    \begin{quote}
%    \nametest{Doe, John, Jr.}
%    \nametest{Doe, John}
%    \nametest{Doe, , Jr.}
%    \nametest{Doe}
%    \nametest{, John, Jr.}
%    \nametest{, John}
%    \nametest{, , Jr.}
%    \nametest{}
%    \end{quote}
%    Not all of these forms are legal, of course, but that's no excuse
%    for not parsing them correctly.
%
%    We also want to be somewhat lenient about the placement of
%    spaces:
%    \begin{quote}
%    \nametest{ Doe,John,Jr.}
%    \end{quote}
%
%    However, because one must have some standards, we assume there
%    are no spaces in the following positions in the input:
%    \begin{enumerate}
%    \item before periods,
%
%    \item before commas,
%
%    \item at the end of the name,
%
%    \item before or after hyphens.
%    \end{enumerate}
%
%    Thus, we make no attempt to compensate for the misplaced spaces
%    in examples like these:
%    \begin{quote}
%    \nametest{Doe , J ., Jr. }
%    \nametest{Doe, J. - M.}
%    \end{quote}
%
%    Also, unless we are generating initials, we don't try to
%    normalize spaces \emph{after} periods:
%    \begin{quote}
%    \nametest{Doe, J.M.}\\ (not G=\embrace{J. M.})
%    \end{quote}
%
%    Finally, since we allow authors to group together characters that
%    should be treated as a single unit, we need to be careful to
%    preserve the author's markup in cases like these:
%
%    \begin{quote}
%    \nametest{Doe, {Yu}ri}
%    \nametest{Doe, {Yu}}
%    \end{quote}
%
%    This is harder than it seems.  For example, consider a naive
%    implementation that uses delimited arguments to pull the name
%    apart:
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \def\parsename#1,#2\@nil{%
%        \def\bib'surname{#1}%
%        \def\bib'given{#2}%
%    }
%
%    \parsename Doe, {Yu}ri\@nil
%\end{verbatim}
%    Unfortunately, this results in the space after the comma
%    becoming part of \cs{bib'given}: ``\verb+ {Yu}ri+''.
%
%    Our next thought would be to modify the definition slightly to
%    trick \TeX\ into gobbling the space:
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \def\parsename#1,#2#3\@nil{%
%        \def\bib'surname{#1}%
%        \def\bib'given{#2#3}%
%    }
%\end{verbatim}
%    Now the space is gone, but---surprise!---so are the braces:
%    ``\verb+Yuri+''.  In addition, this approach makes it difficult
%    to handle empty name parts correctly.
%
%    To sidestep these problems, instead of blindly gobbling macro
%    arguments, we use \cs{futurelet} to look ahead at certain
%    strategic moments so we can take the appropriate action (see
%    \cs{get@namepart@d}--|f|).  We only really care about preserving
%    braces at the start of names (page~\pageref{initial-braces}),
%    which simplifies things somewhat.\label{brace-preservation}
%
%    \begin{macro}{\name@split}
%    \cs{name@split} parses a name into its three parts and stores
%    them in \cs{bib'surname}, \cs{bib'given} and \cs{bib'jr}.  If the
%    \opt{initials} option is in force, it also extracts the initials
%    from the given name and stores them in \cs{bib'initials}.
%
%    It expects the name to be parsed to be terminated by \cs{@nil}
%    and to contain at least three commas.  Thus the usual way to
%    invoke it is
%    \begin{quote}
%    \cs{name@split} $\langle\mathit{name}\rangle$\verb+,,,\@nil+
%    \end{quote}
%
%    \cs{name@split} just uses \cs{get@namepart} to peal off the
%    surname and then passes control to \cs{name@split@given}.
%    (Note the spiffy continuation-passing programming style.)
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\name@split{%
    \get@namepart\bib'surname\name@split@given
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{macro}
%
%    \begin{macro}{\name@split@given}
%    Pretty much the same, \em{mutatis mutandis}\ldots
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\name@split@given{%
    \get@namepart\bib'given\name@split@jr
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{macro}
%
%    \begin{macro}{\name@split@jr}
%    And again\ldots
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\name@split@jr{%
    \get@namepart\bib'jr\name@split@finish
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{macro}
%
%    \begin{macro}{\name@split@finish}
%    We have all three parts now.  Do some consistency checking,
%    extract the initials from the given name, and then call
%    \cs{@nilgobble} to remove anything (such as extra commas) left on
%    the stack.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\name@split@finish{%
    \ifx\bib'surname\@empty \EmptyNameWarning \fi
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Theoretically, we could try to check for uninverted names here,
%    but only at the risk of producing spurious warnings when the name
%    really does only have one part (\verb+author={Arvind}+).
%
%    A possible solution: Now that we have the
%    \attr{inverted} attribute, we could issue a warning if the given

%    Now for the fun part.  \cs{get@namepart} takes two arguments.
%    The first (the destination) should be a control sequence; the
%    second (the continuation) will normally also be a control
%    sequence, though technically we only require that it be a single
%    token.  \cs{get@namepart} scans everything up to the next level-0
%    comma, places it in the destination, and then calls the
%    continuation.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\get@namepart#1#2{%

%    Save the destination in \cs{toks@} and the continuation in

%    We're at the beginning of the name part.  However, there are

%    \begin{macro}{\get@namepart@e}
%    If the next token is a comma, it means the name part is empty;
%    so, we set the destination to an empty list and then arrange to

%    call \cs{get@namepart@f} to read a non-empty name, leaving

% \subsection{Extracting initials}
%
%    Extracting initials from the author's given name is tricky
%    because of the numerous special cases that need to be
%    handled. Consider the following examples, some of which are
%    admittedly contrived:
%    \begin{quote}
%    \initialtest{Arvind}
%    \initialtest{Bing, R H}
%    \initialtest{Harish, \'Etienne}
%    \initialtest{Harish, \'E.}
%    \initialtest{Harish, \'{E}.}
%    \initialtest{Harish, {\'E}.}
%    \initialtest{Harish, \'E}
%    \initialtest{Harish, \'Etienne-P\^{\i}erre}
%    \initialtest{Jones, David}
%    \initialtest{Jones, David-Michael}
%    \initialtest{Katzenbach, Nicholas {deB}elleville}
%    \initialtest{Katzenbach, Nicholas deB.}
%    \initialtest{Matiyasevich, {Yu}ri}
%    \initialtest{Matiyasevich, {Yu}}
%    \initialtest{Matiyasevich, Yu.}
%    \end{quote}
%    When processing initials, we loosen our strictures on spaces
%    inside the given name by not requiring spaces after periods and
%    tolerating them around hyphens and after the name:
%    \begin{quote}
%    \initialtest{Jones, D.M.}
%    \initialtest{Jones, David - Michael}
%    \initialtest{Jones, David , Jr.}
%    \end{quote}
%    (Strictly speaking, only the support for the first of these
%    examples was a deliberate design decision; the other two are
%    side-effects of the implementation.  In any case, toleration of
%    these quirks is in no way an endorsement of them, especially
%    since they may make it more difficult for third-party software to
%    correctly process bibliography entries.)
%
%^^A    We also make one additional assumption: a hyphen does not occur
%^^A    as the last character in the name.
%
% \subsubsection{The algorithm}
%
%    As a running example, consider the following contrived input:
%    \begin{quote}
%    {\tt \verb+\'E.-P\^{\i}erre J.K. M+}
%    \end{quote}
%    which we want to turn into {\makeatletter``{\'E}.~\ini@hyphen
%    P.~J.~K.~M''}.
%
%    We precede by stages.
%    \begin{enumerate}
%
%    \item
%    Normalize the name by surrounding accents and their arguments by
%    braces:
%    \begin{quote}
%    \verb+{\'E}.-P{\^\i }erre J.K. M+
%    \end{quote}
%    We also replace \verb+~+s by spaces at this stage.
%
%    \item
%    Replace each hyphen (\verb+-+) by ``\verb*+ \ini@hyphen +'':
%    \begin{quote}
%    \verb+{\'E}. \ini@hyphen  P{\^\i }erre J.K. M+
%    \end{quote}
%
%    \item
%    Add a space after each period:
%    \begin{quote}
%    \verb+{\'E}.  \ini@hyphen  P{\^\i }erre J. K.  M+
%    \end{quote}
%
%    \item
%    Now we have the name as a list of space-separated components.
%    (In our example, the components are ``\verb+{\'E}.+'',
%    ``\verb+\ini@hyphen+'', ``\verb+P{\^\i }erre+'', ``\verb+J.+'',
%    ``\verb+K.+'', and ``\verb+M+''.)  We loop through the compoments
%    and replace each one by its ``initialized'' form.  There are
%    four cases:\label{initial_cases}
%    \begin{enumerate}
%
%    \item
%    The component ends in a period.  Copy it and add the token
%    \verb+~+.  (In our example, these are the
%    components ``\verb+{\'E}.+'', ``\verb+J.+'' and ``\verb+K.+''.)
%
%    \item
%    The component consists of a single (possibly compound) character
%    without a period.  Again, copy it and add
%    \verb+~+.  (In our example, this is the component
%    ``\verb+M+''.)
%
%    \item
%    The component is the token \verb+\ini@hyphen+.  Copy it.
%
%    \item
%    The component consts of two or more (possibly compound)
%    characters without a period (e.g., ``\verb+P{\^\i }erre+'').
%    Copy the first character and add the tokens \verb+.~+.
%    \end{enumerate}
%
%    \item
%    The token list generated above will end with an unwanted |~|.
%    Delete it.
%
%    \end{enumerate}
%
%    The end result is
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    {\'E}.~\ini@hyphen P.~J.~K.~M
%\end{verbatim}
%    which, when typeset, does indeed produce
%    {\makeatletter''{\'E}.~\ini@hyphen P.~J.~K.~M''}.\footnote{Tying
%    all the characters together is potentially undesirable when, as
%    in the example, there are a large number of pieces in the given
%    name.}
%
% \subsubsection{The implementation}
%
%    \begin{macro}{\extract@initials}

% \subsection{Generating alphabetic labels}
%
% \subsubsection{The algorithm}
%
%    Like Gaul, an alphabetic label is divided into three parts.
%    \begin{enumerate}
%
%    \item The author part.  In the simplest case, this is formed by
%    extracting the first character of each word of each last name of
%    each author.  Thus, if there were two authors with last names
%    ``Vaughan Williams'' and ``Tallis'', the author part would be
%    ``VWT''.
%
%    If there are more than four authors, only the first three names
%    are used, and a superscript~``+'' is appended to represent the
%    elided names.  Similarly, if an author name is ``others'',
%    it is replaced by a superscript~``+'' and any following author
%    names (of which there shouldn't be any) are ignored.
%
%    Finally, if there is only one author and the author's last name
%    consists of a single word, the first three characters of that
%    name are used.
%
%    \item The year part.  If the \opt{y2k} option is in force, or if
%    the year is less than~1901, the entire year is used.  Otherwise
%    the last two digits of the year are used.\footnote{Years with
%    more than 4 digits are not currently handled correctly.
%    \emph{Caveat lector}.}
%
%    The combination of author part and year part will be referred to
%    as the \emph{stem}.
%
%    \item[3.] The suffix.  If two or more items have the same stems,
%    a suffix consisting of a lowercase latin letter will be appended
%    to each label to make it unique.
%
%    \end{enumerate}
%
%    \label{stem-comparison}
%    This third part is more subtle than it might first appear.
%    First, case is ignored when comparing stems, so that, for
%    example, ``Ahl1999'' and ``AHL1999'' are considered identical.
%    Second, existing practice (in English, at least), is to ignore
%    diacritics so that, for example, ``Ahl1999'' and ``\"Ahl1999''
%    are considered identical.
%
%    Note that when checking for duplicate stems, we assume that
%    bibliography items appear sorted by label, which means that all
%    items with the same stem will be adjacent.  This means we can use
%    the naive algorithm (check to see if the current item has the
%    same stem as the previous item and, if so, append a suffix) to
%    detect clashes.  This sorting will be done automatically by
%    \bst{amsxport}, but the document author is responsible for
%    ensuring the appropriate order if \bst{amsxport} is not used.
%    This is why it's an error to mix the \opt{alphabetic} and
%    \opt{citation-order} options.
%

\def\generate@alphalabel{%

%    If the user supplied an explicit \fld{label} field, we use it.
%    Otherwise, we generate our own.
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \ifx\bib'label\@empty
        \begingroup
%    \end{macrocode}
%    We begin by saving the previous stem and initializing the
%    current stem to the empty string.
%    \begin{macrocode}
            \global\let\previous@stem\current@stem
            \global\let\current@stem\amsrefs@label@prefix
%    \end{macrocode}
%    The list of primary contributors is available to us in
%    \cs{current@primary} in the form
%    \begin{quote}
%    \cnm{name}{$\mathrm{Last}_1, \mathrm{First}_1$}%
%    \cnm{name}{$\mathrm{Last}_2, \mathrm{First}_2$}
%     \ldots
%    \cnm{name}{$\mathrm{Last}_n, \mathrm{First}_n$}
%    \end{quote}
%    We will be executing this list multiple times with various
%    definitions of \cs{name}.  So the first thing we want to do is
%    establish a safe environment and normalize the names.
%    \begin{macrocode}
            \@apply\auto@protect\amsrefs@textsymbols
            \@apply\auto@protect\amsrefs@textaccents
            \auto@protect\name
            \auto@protect\etaltext
            \normalize@edef\@tempa\current@primary
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Now we count the number of authors in the list and invoke the
%    appropriate macro to calculate the author part of the
%    reference label.
%    \begin{macrocode}
            \get@numberof\@tempcnta\name\@tempa
            \calc@author@part
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Next append the year part.
%    \begin{macrocode}
            \append@label@year
%    \end{macrocode}
%    At this point, the \cs{current@stem} is complete and we're ready
%    to determine what (if any) suffix is needed to disambiguate
%    it from the previous label.
%    \begin{macrocode}
            \calc@alpha@suffix
%    \end{macrocode}
%    We have all the pieces now.  Arrange to end the current group and
%    then define \cs{bib@label} in the enclosing group.  (This keeps
%    \cs{bib@label} from being defined outside the group started by
%    \cs{bib@start}.  This isn't strictly necessary, but it provides a
%    bit of compartmentalization.)

% \subsection{Generating short alphabetic labels}
%
%    This style for alphabetic labels is somewhat simpler than the
%    regular alphabetic style.  The stem consists only of an author
%    part without a year part.  The author part is formed in the same
%    way, except that even when there is only a single author with a
%    one-word last name, only the first letter of the name is used,
%    not the first three.  Finally, the suffix used to disambiguate
%    identical stems is numeric rather than alphabetic.
%
%    See section~\ref{opt:shortalphabetic} on
%    page~\pageref{opt:shortalphabetic} for the implementation.
%
% \subsection{Formatting series}
%
%    The \cn{PrintSeries} command prints a list of objects in series
%    form. The essential idea is to produce something like \qq{A, B, and
%    C} when we are given three elements ``A'', ``B'', and ``C'', with
%    suitable variations in the punctuation and other intervening
%    material depending on the number of elements.
%
%    More precisely, we can envision \cn{PrintSeries} being
%    called as
%    \begin{quote}
%    |\PrintSeries{|$S$|}{|$i_1$|}{|$i_2$|}{|$i_3$|}{|$E$|}{\do{|$T_1$|}| \dots|\do{|$T_n$|}}|
%\end{quote}
%    where $S$ and~$E$ are material to be interpolated before the
%    start and after the end of the list, respectively,
%    $i_1$, \dots, $i_3$ are material to be interpolated between the
%    elements, and the final argument is a list of indeterminate
%    length where each element consists of a macro and its
%    argument. If there are exactly two elements, $i_1$ is inserted
%    between them; otherwise, $i_2$ is inserted between each pair of
%    items except for the last pair, where $i_3$ is inserted.  Thus,
%    \begin{center}
%    \begin{tabular}{ll}
%    $n$    & output \\
%    1      & $S$ $T_1$ $E$ \\
%    2      & $S$ $T_1$ $i_1$ $T_2$ $E$ \\
%    3      & $S$ $T_1$ $i_2$ $T_2$ $i_3$ $T_3$ $E$ \\
%    4      & $S$ $T_1$ $i_2$ $T_2$ $i_2$ $T_3$ $i_3$ $T_4$ $E$
%^^A    \\$>4$   & $S$ $T_1$ $i_2$ $T_2$ $i_2$ $T_3$ \dots $T_{n-1}$ $i_3$ $T_n$ $E$
%    \end{tabular}
%    \end{center}
%    and so forth.  For example, a standard comma-separated list could
%    be formatted by
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \PrintSeries{}{ and }{, }{, and }{}{...}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%    That is the simple case but in practice there are
%    additional complications. What if user-supplied line breaks have to
%    be supported at the boundaries between elements? What if in
%    addition to adding material between elements we also want to apply
%    some handy function to each element (e.g., \cn{textsc})? Even
%    worse, what if we want the function to be different depending on
%    the position of the element in the list? Indeed if this did not
%    happen to be the case with the current application I would not have
%    gone to the extra trouble of supporting it. But if it must be so,
%    then the output that we need from a list |\do{A}\do{B}...| is
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    f0{A}
%    f0{A} p1 i1 f1{B}
%    f0{A} p2 i2 f2{B} p3 i3 f3{B}
%\end{verbatim}
%    and so on, where
% \begin{itemize}
% \item $f_n$ is a macro taking one argument,
% \item $p_n$ is punctuation\mdash material that must precede a line
%    break if one occurs at this boundary,
% \item $i_n$ other interpolated material, as before.
% \end{itemize}
%    To reduce the number of distinct required objects we decree that
%    each element will get braces wrapped around it as a matter of
%    course; then it is possible for $f_1$, $f_2$, $f_3$ to be
%    assimilated onto the tail end of $i_1$, $i_2$, $i_3$.  Since we
%    also have to specify the macro that delimits the elements
%    of the list, we end up with the following rather formidable
%    signature:
%    \begin{quote}\raggedright
%    |\PrintSeries{\m} {|$f_0$|}|
%    |{|$p_1$|}{|$i_1 f_1$|}| |{|$p_2$|}{|$i_2 f_2$|}|
%    |{|$p_3$|}{|$i_3 f_3$|}|
%    \hspace*{2 em} |{|$S$|} {\m{|$T_1$|}|$\dots$|\m{|$T_n$|}} {|$E$|}|
%\end{quote}
%    and our comma-separated list example becomes
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \PrintSeries{\do}{} {}{ and } {,}{ } {,}{ and } {}{...}{}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%    \begin{macro}{\series@index}

%    the ordinal number of the item currently being processed.

%    \begin{macro}{\SwapBreak}
%    This takes a single argument, which should begin with a
%    punctuation character, and conditionally appends it to the
%    current horizontal list after removing any preceding whitespace.
%    If there was also a penalty at the end of the hlist (presumed to
%    be the result of a |\linebreak| at the end of a field value), it
%    moves the penalty to \emph{after} the argument.
%
%    \begin{bug}
%    \cn{SwapBreak} interferes with \TeX's kerning mechanism.  For
%    example, consider a field value that ends with a~``y'' and that
%    should have a comma automatically appended.  \pkg{amsrefs}
%    generates the equivalent of |y\SwapBreak{,}|, which results in
%    ``y\SwapBreak{,}'' (no kern before the comma) rather than~``y,''.
%    Unfortunately, fixing this would likely require a
%    disproportionate effort.  In cases where the lack of kerning is
%    unacceptable, a workaround is to add the punctuation mark to the
%    field value manually.  For example, |title={...y,}| would
%    generate the equivalent of |y,\SwapBreak{,}|, which in turn would
%    produce ``y,\SwapBreak{,}'' since \cs{SwapBreak} is careful not
%    to add duplicate punctuation.
%    \end{bug}
%    \begin{macrocode}
\def\SwapBreak#1{%
    \relax\ifvmode\leavevmode\fi
    \@tempcnta\@MM
    \toks@{#1}%
%    \end{macrocode}
%    First, remove any preceding glue.  (There usually shouldn't be
%    any of this.)
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \unskip
%    \end{macrocode}
%    There might be also be kern, typically an italic correction left
%    there by a previous \texttt{TextFontCommand} like \ncn{textit}.
%    But don't remove the special 1\,sp kern used to mark the
%    beginning of a bibliography entry.
%
%    \begin{bug}
%    Sometimes we want to keep the italic correction.
%    \end{bug}
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \ifnum \lastkern>\@ne \unkern \fi
%    \end{macrocode}
%    And now look for a penalty and stash it in a safe place.
%    \begin{macrocode}
    \ifnum\lastpenalty=\z@
    \else
        \@tempcnta\lastpenalty
        \unpenalty
    \fi
%    \end{macrocode}
%    Now we add the punctuation, \emph{unless} one of the following
%    conditions is true:
%    \begin{enumerate}
%
%    \item
%    The last item on the horizontal list was a kern of~1\,sp,
%    indicating that we're at the very beginning of a bibliography
%    item.
%
%    \item
%    The current space factor is equal to the \cs{sfcode} of the
%    puncutation mark we are adding, meaning that the mark is already
%    on the list.
%
%    \item
%    The current space factor is equal to the special value
%    |\@nopunctsfcode|, meaning that |\nopunct| was specified.
%
%    \end{enumerate}
%    This relies on distinct punctuation marks having distinct space
%    factors, as established by our definition of \cn{frenchspacing}.

% \subsection{Formatting names and series of names}\label{name-style}
%
%    Now that we have a general mechanism for formatting series, we
%    can easily specialize to the common case of a comma-separated
%    list of names.  First we provide specifications for the three
%    most common name formats.
%
%    \begin{macro}{\setbib@nameLE}
%    This sets a name in standard western uninverted order, e.g.,
%    ``John Doe Jr.''  (The ``LE'' stands for little-endian.)
%    \begin{macrocode}
\BibSpec{nameLE}{
    +{}{}{given}
    +{}{\IfEmptyBibField{given}{}{ }}{surname}
    +{}{ }{jr}
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{macro}
%
%    \begin{macro}{\setbib@nameBE}
%    Big-endian order, as used for example in traditional Chinese,
%    Japanese, Vietnamese, and Hungarian names: ``Doe John''.
%    Big-endian formatting can be requested for name by setting the
%    ``inverted'' property to ``yes.''
%    \begin{macrocode}
\BibSpec{nameBE}{
    +{}{}{surname}
    +{}{ }{given}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    I don't know what should happen if there's a suffix, so I'm going
%    to just leave it out for now (although I should probably issue a
%    warning).  I suspect that either (a)~it never comes up or (b)~if
%    it does come up, there's no set standard for how it should be
%    handled.
%    \begin{macrocode}
%    +{}{ }{jr}
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{macro}
%
%    \begin{macro}{\setbib@nameinverted}
%    Inverted western-style names: ``Doe, John, Jr.''
%    \begin{macrocode}
\BibSpec{nameinverted}{
    +{} {}  {surname}
    +{,}{ } {given}
    +{,}{ } {jr}
}
%    \end{macrocode}
%    \end{macro}
%
%    Incidentally, it would probably be cleaner if names had their
%    own namespace like properties do, i.e., something like
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \DefineSimpleKey{name}{given}
%    \DefineSimpleKey{name}{initials}
%    \DefineSimpleKey{name}{surname}
%    \DefineSimpleKey{name}{jr}
%\end{verbatim}
%    followed by
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \NameSpec{nameLE}{...}
%\end{verbatim}
%    or
%    \begin{verbatim}
%    \BibSpec[name]{nameLE}{...}
%\end{verbatim}
%    But this seems a little extravagant at this stage, so I've
%    decided to leave things as-is for now.
%
%    \begin{macro}{\PrintNames}
%    \cn{PrintNames} is a simplified interface to \cs{PrintSeries} that
%    takes only the last three arguments:
%    \begin{quote}\raggedright
%    |\PrintNames {|$S$|} {|$E$|} {\name{|$T_1$|}|$\dots$|\name{|$T_n$|}}|
%\end{quote}
%    The order of the last two arguments is reversed to make it
%    moderately easier to use; cf.\ \cn{PrintEditorsA}, etc.
%
%    The first name in a series is treated differently than the other
%    names in the \opt{author-year} style, so we use a separate
%    formatting macro for it.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\newcommand{\PrintNames}{%
    \@ifstar{\PrintNames@a\set@othername}{\PrintNames@a\set@firstname}%

%
% \subsubsection{The \opt{backrefs} option}
%    Rather than checking for the \opt{backrefs} option \emph{per se},
%    we check to see if the \pkg{backref} package is loaded.  This
%    accomodates authors who load the \pkg{backref} package explicitly
%    but do not pass the \opt{backrefs} option to \pkg{amsrefs}.
%    \begin{macrocode}
\AtBeginDocument{%
    \@ifpackageloaded{backref}{%
        \let\PrintBackRefs\print@backrefs
        \let\BackCite\back@cite
%    \end{macrocode}
%    The \pkg{backref} package uses \cn{@starttoc} inside
%    \cn{thebibliography} to open and read the \fn{.brf} file.  We
%    could do something similar with \cn{biblist}, but it seems
%    cleaner to use \cn{AtBeginDocument}.  Unfortunately, \cls{amsart}
%    redefines \cn{@starttoc} in a way that interacts badly with this
%    use.  So, we inline the relevant parts of \cn{@starttoc} here.
%    (The group and \cn{makeatletter} are unnecessary at present, but
%    I'll leave them in as future-proofing.)

%    We begin by saving the previous stem and initializing the

%    The list of primary contributors is available to us in
%    \cs{current@primary} in the form
%    \begin{quote}
%    \cnm{name}{$\mathrm{Last}_1, \mathrm{First}_1$}%
%    \cnm{name}{$\mathrm{Last}_2, \mathrm{First}_2$}
%     \ldots
%    \cnm{name}{$\mathrm{Last}_n, \mathrm{First}_n$}
%    \end{quote}
%    We will be executing this list multiple times with various
%    definitions of \cs{name}.  So the first thing we want to do is
%    establish a safe environment and normalize the names.
%    \begin{macrocode}
            \@apply\auto@protect\amsrefs@textsymbols

            \xdef\current@stem{\current@stem}%
%    \end{macrocode}
%    At this point, the \cs{current@stem} is complete and we're ready
%    to determine what (if any) suffix is needed to disambiguate
%    it from the previous label.
%    \begin{macrocode}
            \calc@alpha@suffix
%    \end{macrocode}
%    We have all the pieces now.  Arrange to end the current group and
%    then define \cs{bib@label} in the enclosing group.  (This keeps
%    \cs{bib@label} from being defined outside the group started by
%    \cs{bib@start}.  This isn't strictly necessary, but it provides a
%    bit of compartmentalization.)
