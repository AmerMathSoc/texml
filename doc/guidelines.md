# Guidelines

* Every graphic must be either inline or in a `figure` environment.  The
  float package's `H` location specifier can be helpful here.

* Every table must be inside a `table` environment.

* Do not use the `center` environment.

* Make sure every url is correctly encoding using `\url`, `\href`, or
  some similar macro.
