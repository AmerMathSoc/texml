\begin{NLMnote}{Note on the Kindle edition}

This is a Kindle edition of a book that was originally designed for
print.  It contains all of the content, both textual and graphical, of
the original print edition, but extensive changes to the visual format
and layout have been necessary to adapt it to the Kindle environment.
In some cases, this means that directions that refer to the relative
location of a figure on the page (“see the figure to the right”) have
been left untouched even though they are no longer strictly accurate.
References to page numbers have generally been reworded and replaced
by links.
